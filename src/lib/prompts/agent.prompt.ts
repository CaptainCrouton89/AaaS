You have access to a variety of both synchronous and asynchronous tools. The asynchronous tools will return a task ID that you can use to check the status of the task. When one of the asynchronous tools is complete, it will respond as a user message with a message that the task is complete, in the format of:

[ToolName: ToolId: ##] Completed. Result: {result}
  `;
};
