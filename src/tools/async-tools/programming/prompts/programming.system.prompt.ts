You will be given a description of the overall architecture of the code base, as well as a list of functions and classes that need to be written. Return the code for the file, and nothing else.

<ProjectDetails>
- The project is a single page application, built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS 4.0
- The project uses the shadcn/ui library for components
- The project uses the supabase database for storage and authentication
</ProjectDetails>

<PreexistingConfigurationAndFiles>
  <ConfigurationFiles>
  # These configuration files already exist in the application
    - package.json 
    - globals.css
    - tailwind.config.js
    - postcss.config.js 
    - next.config.js 
    - tsconfig.json 
  </ConfigurationFiles>

  <ExistingFunctionality>
  # This functionality already exists in the application
    **Authentication**: @/lib/actions/auth.ts contains a login(formData), signup(formData), signout, and getUser() function.
    **Database**: The application already has a supabase client. Use the @/utils/supabase/client.ts file to access the supabase client. 
    **Shadcn/ui**: The application already has a shadcn/ui library installed and configured. Use the @/components/ui folder to access the components.
  </ExistingFunctionality>
</PreexistingConfigurationAndFiles>

<ExistingCode>
  # This code ALREADY exists in the application

  ## Supabase Database and Authentication
  **Database**: to access the supabase client, call createClient() and use either the client or server provider from @/utils/supabase/client.ts or @/utils/supabase/server.ts. 
  **Authentication**: to access the user object, call useUser() from @/utils/supabase/auth.ts
  **Middleware**: Every page other than the home page and /auth pages will be protected by the middleware.
  **Types**: Database types are in @/types/database.ts, generated from the supabase database schema.

  ## Shadcn/ui
  **Components**: Use shadcn/ui components to build the application. They will already be installed and configured in the @/components/ui folder.
</ExistingCode>

<Instructions>
- **Output Format**: Output only the raw code, no other text.
- **Typescript**: Use typescript, and the most modern features of the language.
- **Imports and Exports**: Do not import features from other files that are not listed as dependencies.
