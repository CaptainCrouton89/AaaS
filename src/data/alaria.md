# Advantage and Disadvantage

Tags: mechanics

[Advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) and [disadvantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) make it easier or harder to succeed at a roll, respectively.

When you have [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) on a roll, compare your heart die and whichever ability die you are using for the roll. Whichever is lower, roll an additional die of that size. Then, take the highest two results from those dice. So for example, if you had a d8 and a d6, you would instead roll 1d8 and 2d6, and take the two highest results (note that they may be both on the d6s!).

[Disadvantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) works in reverse. Roll an additional die, but this time roll an additional copy of the _larger_ die instead. Then, take the lowest two results. Let's say you would normally roll a d8 and a d4. You instead roll 2d8 and a d4. Let's say the results are 2, 7, 1. 2 + 1 = 3, so you would treat the result as a 3.\n\n------------\n

# Aether

Tags: material

Aether is the primary meta-fluid source of energy on [Lanthornia](Lanthornia)—a nearby planar stack. An eruption on lanthornia caused a sizable quantity of aether and lanthornium to be expelled from the planar stack and land in Alaria.

Some creatures of Alaria have some sensitivity to the material and can manipulate it and pull it out of the air. Aether is used to power sky ships and a number of other machines and contraptions.

Raw Aether spends most of it's time in the air—inert, invisible, and immaterial. However, it can be extracted and processed with a little water, turning it into a powerful fuel. On contact with a purified lanthornium vibrating at a specific frequency, the aether will begin to expand, losing it's bond with the water and becoming non-substantive once more. There are many similarities to a steam engine. Aether engines frequently involve lanthornium plates being struck to start, causing an self-striking process to continue feeding more aether and lanthornium strikes.

## Lanthornium

An uncommon, gray-blue type of stone that requires some expensive processing to purify.\n\n------------\n

# Aetherial Reckoning

Tags: event

A mysterious cult known as the [Aetherial Reckoners](Aetherial Reckoners) exists, claiming to possess knowledge of an impending cosmic event called the Aetherial Reckoning. They believe that harnessing the latent energy released during this event could grant unimaginable power to those who survive. Many dismiss it as a fringe belief, but whispers of strange occurrences aligning with their predictions spread across Alaria.\n\n------------\n

Welcome! This is the Almanac of [Alaria](Alaria)—a guide to the world of [Alaria](Alaria). It aims to provide enough information to answer any of the Big Questions™ ranging all the way from "How does [magic](Magic) work?" down to "Why is this country at war with this other country?" Hopefully you find it useful for whatever your needs may be.

# About Alaria

The Alarian [Planar Stack](Planar Stack), also commonly known as [Alaria](Alaria), is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several [planes](Planes), stacked on top of each other.

# [Geography](Geography) of the [Planes](Planes)

## Material Plane

In the very middle is the [Material Plane](Material Plane)—a world of kingdoms and conquest and [magic](Magic), dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the [Material Plane](Material Plane)—as though on the flip side—lies [Celesté](Celesté): the realm of [daemons](Daemons). It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane.

### [Celesté](Celesté)

Celesté was created when the Alarian Planar Stack fragmented and Ezz poured in from beyond. The material plane peeled apart and a new plane of conceptual existence was born. Emotion, free will, and thought poured into Alaria. Celesté is made of the coalescense of thought/emotion/etc on the material plane. Where there is thought, there is a counterpart to the material planes.

<hr/>
## [Astral Plane](Astral Plane)

"Above" the [Material Plane](Material Plane) is the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane). Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is home to [ghosts](Ghosts), and consists of small [desert](Deserts) islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright [white sun](Aurus, the White Sun). The [spirit](Life and Death) cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of [Aurus](Aurus, the White Sun), living pawns of his will.

### [Astraeva](Astraeva)

On the flip side of the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is [Astraeva](Astraeva). Astraeva mirrors the Astral Plane but is devoid of souls. [Aurus](Aurus, the White Sun) has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

<hr/>
## [Malstaris](Malstaris)

"Below" the Material Plane is [Malstaris](Malstaris)—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane), it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of [Nydus](Nydus, the Black Sun), living pawns of his will.

### [Eindumor](Eindumor)

On its flip side of Malstaris is [Eindumor](Eindumor). Eindumor mirrors Malstaris but is devoid of shadows. Nydus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

<hr/>
## Elemental Planes

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the [elemental planes](Elemental Planes), each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers.

## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the [Ethereal](Ethereal Plane) and [Nethereal](Nethereal Plane) Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones [spirit](Life and Death), among other types of energy, can be found on these planes.

<hr/>
## Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry.

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in [Celesté](Celesté).

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of [Malstaris](Malstaris) would take you to Eindumor.

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or [Malstaris](Malstaris) requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other [planes](Planes) is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the [elemental planes](Elemental Planes), and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal [Planes](Planes), none can sustain [spirit](Life and Death), [soul](Life and Death), or [shadow](Life and Death).

# Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of [Alaria](Alaria). It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the [planar stack](Planar Stack). Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform [magic](Magic) on [Alaria](Alaria).

# Aldriktch Trade Alliance

# Overview

The [Aldriktch Trade Alliance](Aldriktch Trade Alliance) is an agreement between [Erasnus](Erasnus), [Watar](Watar), [Myorna](Myorna), [Camaran](Camaran), [Bestacia](Bestacia), and [Ubrik](Ubrik) that dictates open trade routes between the countries. It sets limits on maximum tariffs for ports and foreign trade, and gives member nations more favorable trading rights.

Currently, the entie alliance is under threat, as tensions between [Myorna](Myorna) and its neighbors continue to rise. Allowing [Myorna](Myorna) into the trade alliance was only barely permitted (spear headed by phenomenal diplomats from both [Myorna](Myorna), [Ubrik](Ubrik), and Bestacia), and now it's causing trouble.

It is also threated by the massive silvertongue outbreak in [Ubrik](Ubrik), which has driven half the country into a canabalistic frenzy, terrorizing the nearby countryside. [Erasnus](Erasnus) is desperately trying to hold the alliance together (it is most profitable for them of all the countries), but it is difficult to hold on.

[Camaran](Camaran) has become more isolationist recently as well, which spells trouble, and the Watari and Bestacians relations are getting worse as tension over control of the Telphineas Strait escalates.

# History

[Echea](Echea) was vetoed by [Camaran](Camaran). [Myorna](Myorna) was partially let in because people wanted access to the incredible quanities of silver in those mountains. Bestacian diplomats also hoped that it would deter war.\n\n------------\n

# Astral Plane

## Geography

The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) consists of a massive sea with floating islands, consisting of a special stone-like material that floats in Astral solution. Like icebergs, larger islands are cliff-edged, and tower into the sky, while smaller islands ride much lower. Huge disasters occur when an island rolls over due to the massiver earthquakes they deal with (due to structural instability). These quakes can cause astral stone to break free, showering down on the earth.

The Astral Sea is filled with beautiful shining lights, which are the stars on the [material plane](Material Plane). These lights were created by the titans. The Astral Sea is nearly opaque, which is why the giant islands high in the sky are not visible. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is lit up from above by [Aurus, the White Sun](Aurus, the White Sun), which illuminates all souls on the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane), but cannot penetrate down to the [material plane](Material Plane) through the Astral Sea.

No [maps](Maps) chart these lands, as the islands, as their locations are constantly changing.

Massive cities are built in these islands.

### The Astral Sea

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea.

## The [Soul](Life and Death)

The [soul](Life and Death) is slightly influenced by astral currents in the astral sea, and good ship captains can sense them to navigate astral currents well.

The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is illuminated by the [Aurus, the White Sun](Aurus, the White Sun) (counterpart to [Nydus, the Black Sun](Nydus, the Black Sun)). Souls are illuminated in its light.

All souls of the living go to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) upon death. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. \*\*\* is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) vie for his position.

## Fauna

#### Astral Sentinels

In the Astral Plane, massive ethereal creatures known as Astral Sentinels roam the islands. These creatures, remnants of forgotten celestial battles, are attracted to disturbances in psychic energy. They serve as both protectors and dangers to astral travelers.

#### Symbiots

Some inhabitants of the Astral Plane have developed a symbiotic relationship with astral creatures. These beings, known as Astral Weavers, use the threads of psychic energy to weave protective barriers or manipulate the weakened free will of other astral entities.

# Athatgarun

Tags: character

Athatgarun is a satyr demigod. Child of a ferocious satyr fire-dancer warrior and the human/god [Ricyl](Ricyl), a god with a huge personality and enormous strength. Never met father but became close with his mother. Personality very similar to father. Had just begun to follow in his parents' footsteps to likely become an incredibly competent fighter (still a kid at the time), when [titansworn wordkeepers](Titansworn Wordkeepers) arrived at the satyr nomadic camp and began rounding people up to be taken to camps. Mother fought back and died. Athatgarun saw this and snapped, went after them. He also died, but came back as a [revenant](Revenants) for revenge. Spent years burying sorrow and pain in brutal workouts. Approached most problems by overcoming them with strength and perseverence. Nothing was too challenging. Met [Straker](Straker) at one point and spent a year living on the island with him, learning. Abandoned Straker and his training to fight titansworn, during which he crossed paths with [Raiyurna](Raiyurna) who was treating wounded soldiers in what's now [Iylovia](Iylovia).

Since then, the titansworn are pretty much gone and Athatgarun is a bit of a lost [soul](Life and Death). There aren't more titansworn to kill, he can't get his mother back, and he's never been able to contact his father [Ricyl](Ricyl). Perhaps is crazy. Unclear why he's done the things since then, but has maybe taken over Johnny's body because of the somewhat similar histories they share. Possibly has died and regenerated without memories since then, but uncertain.\n\n------------\n

# Atowatowa

Tags: culture, [humans](Humans)

The [Atowatowa](Atowatowa) are a xenophobic group of caribou herders, residing in [Anu'Itiklik](Anu'itiklik). Many are born with natural air attunements, allowing them to soothe the airs immediately around them. The Atowatowa live nomadically, traveling wherever there is lichen for their herd. All of them ride the caribou.

In the far north, a special lichen grows in the mountains that causes the caribou to grow much larger. This lichen is given to special caribou within the herds, which are groomed to be the mounts for leaders within the group. These caribou grow up to 14 feet high.

The Atowatowa disapprove of the mining operation happening in the [Anderegnons](Anderegnons), north and west of Anu'Itiklik.\n\n------------\n

The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them to more easily blend into the forests in which they usually live.

Caerene are far more isolating than many other [races](Races), preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial, day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on Alaria.

An unobservant individual walking through the middle of a Caerene village may not even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the Caerene.

Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and immediate justice. There are no second chances in Caerene culture.

Primarily reside in Eoga.

# Celesté

Tags: [planes](Planes)

The core of Celesté was created long before the entire plane was made. A pocket dimension was solidified as a safe haven from [Nydus](Nydus, the Black Sun) and [Aurus](Aurus, the White Sun), the titan gods. It is a plane that the titan Celesté created by sacrificing herself (titans normally can't die). This created a new dimension of her own. She swore that as long as the titans remembered her sacrifice, they would survive. And thus they did, because she granted them power from her plane. None of the titans could ever enter the plane unless they died, which no one else was willing to do. However she still protected them.

After the Ezz Rift, Ezz accumulated around Celesté, as it was the only location that resonated with Melera's song.

[Celesté](Celesté) is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a reflection of the world but lacking any of the typical life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons).

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the [daemons](Daemons) who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within [Celesté](Celesté).

While in [Celesté](Celesté), you have no body—only a [spirit](Life and Death)—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your [spirit](Life and Death). Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your [true name](True Name) and pray to you. Upon death, your [spirit](Life and Death) sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your [true name](True Name) is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your [shadow](Life and Death) and [soul](Life and Death) behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the [material plane](Material Plane), they will never rebind to your [spirit](Life and Death), making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

[Deoric](Deoric) does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the [material plane](Material Plane).

Celesté is made of the the thoughts and beliefs of those who are alive. The world is shaped by the livings' understanding of it. You can faintly alter your own existence depending on your followers, though you are largely stuck at the whims of the living followers of the Material Plane.

The undead mill aimlessly when not directed by Xynoth or his henchmen. 95% of population are undead (no spirit), but 5% are still pretty evil, but have free will. Have surivived by pillaging and enslaving. Live slaves tend to fields to provide for few remaining living people. Undead keep watch. Relentless army.

Boxed in by sea and mountains, and armies have dwindled. Needs an influx of shadows/souls to resume campaign and cross the mountains or the sea.

Can't get through the smoky mountains cuz the Firesworn are too well burrowed in. Can't get through mountains cuz treacherous and decently defended. Will cross sea once they can build boats, though they have no way of building boats yet.

The undead are unruly and vicious, barely kept in check by [Xynoth Azkonor](Xynoth Azkonor). Cities are in [state](States) of disrepair because everyone is incompetent and selfish. Only know how to steal, not create.

# Building Your Character

As you make a character in Heart Rush, remember that at the center of every Heart Rush character is their heart. It is the foundation on which you build your life, your [soul](Life and Death); it is the chassis and essence of your decisions and their consequences; and it is what drives you forward. You are building an entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.

## Your Dream

With this in mind, build a character that has a vision towards what they want to achieve. You should have a dream of what you want to do in the world, one that is complex and difficult and worthy of the caliber of legend you wish to become. Remember—you determine the direction the story takes. There’s no goal to this game besides the one you set out. So speak with you GM about the world in which the game takes place, and figure out how you want to be remembered. It’s your story, and the stakes are low, so it’s okay to set your sights high.

Once you have come up with something, write this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit or add to it later.

## Your Vitals

These are the core-most stats of your character. They represent the raw capabilities and limits of your mind and body.

### Experience

When the game begins, you will start with some experience (XP). During the game and between sessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills, abilities, hitpoints, and more. See the Experience Options section to learn more. After making your character, you may begin spending your XP.

### Ability Scores

Players have four important stats—might, agility, cunning, and presence. These traits define your physical and mental abilities, and are used to determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task you attempt to do.

Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude. High might allows you to push through locked doors, lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles without rest.

Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses. High cunning allows you to recall information you’ve learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and discern fact from fiction.

Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and reflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a summersault on a tightrope.

Presence is your charm, charisma, and social influence. High presence allows you to persuade guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone about it.

Your prowess in each of these abilities is represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the ability’s corresponding die and add it to the result.

The first step in creating your character is determining which dice you will use for which stat. Typical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability, reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. Likewise, you start with d4s and d6s. You may distribute two d4s and two d6s among your four abilities.

### Hitpoints

Hitpoints (HP) represents your health and stamina. [Humans](Humans) start with 40 hitpoints. Larger creatures have more, smaller creatures generally have less. As your hitpoints fall, bad things happen, and falling to 0 can result in more long lasting effects, as described in the Combat section. You can gain more hitpoints by expending XP.

### Heart

Besides your core ability stats and hitpoints, you also have a heart die, sometimes shortened to just “heart”. This represents your vigor, health, stamina, and overall wellbeing. Your heart die will usually correspond to your hitpoints. With more hitpoints, you have more heart. Small creatures, like rats, generally have a low heart die, such as a d4, whereas large and powerful creatures, like dragons, typically have larger heart dice, such as a d20. [Humans](Humans), and any other [race](Races) you may start the game as, use a d8.

Your heart is important for determining your successes and fails. Nearly every dice roll in this game will require your heart die.

Throughout gameplay, your heart die will increase or decrease in size. This means that you should switch your your heart die with one that is “bigger” or “smaller”. For example, increasing in size from a d6 would mean you would replace it with a d8. Decreasing from a d20 would mean replacing it with a d12.

Losing hitpoints is one such way that your heart die will decrease. In the following chart, find the row corresponding to your maximum hitpoints. Whenever your current hitpoints reaches or falls below one of the numbers in the row, your heart die is set equal to the size corresponding to that column. For example, if you have a maximum of 40 hitpoints, and you take 13 damage, falling to 27 hitpoints, your heart die would decrease in size from a d8 to a d6. It would then remain as a d6 until you reached 13 hitpoints, at which point you would replace your d6 with a d4. You can never have a heart die smaller than a d4.

Nothing can cause your heart die to fall beneath a d4, though there are consequences for reaching 0 hitpoints. Your heart die also cannot increase in size beyond your regular maximum, so until you increase your maximum hitpoints to 100 or more, your heart die cannot grow larger than 1d8.

As you spend XP on hitpoints, your heart die will increase. When you have 100 hitpoints, your maximum heart die becomes a d10 instead of a d8, and when you reach 200 hitpoints, you get a d12.

## Your Niche

### [Races](Races) & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and has a different upbringing. When you create a character, choose a [race](Races) from Appendix A: [Race](Races) & Heritage. You gain the aspects and abilities that come from choosing that [race](Races).

Many [races](Races) have multiple heritages within that [race](Races). In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities of the [race](Races), as well as a chose heritage within that [race](Races).

### Talents

Talents are specialized abilities that you know and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing your play style and differentiating you from anyone else in the world. You do not start with any talents, but they can be purchased with XP, which you will start the game with, and accumulate over play.

### Aspects

Heart Rush is not about ordinary people—it is about people are destined to be remembered, and you are no exception. Over time, you will become either a [hero](Heroes) or a villain, until you eventually retire your character, or else fall to the forces working against you.

When you first create your character, you gain three destiny points (DP). These destiny points can be spent to twist fate in your favor, and to make shine the differences between you and the common rabble. However, they can only be gained by acting out the flaws in your character as well. As your strengths grow, so will your weaknesses. In this way, your successes will become more and more epic, while your failures more and more crushing. This collection of skills, traits, background, habits, and flaws are known as aspects.

Your aspects describe the features and traits from your personality, background, and experiences that make you distinct. Aspects will affect everything you do, and will aid you or hinder you every session. As you play your character, you will gather more aspects, and the relative impact your aspects have will grow. Each aspect has two parts: its description, and its rank.

#### Description

The description describes the aspect as a whole, and should be a phrase or a few words to describe your character. It should be a significant personality trait, behavioral quirk, background, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed title, or some sort of reputation. For example, “Bullheaded,” “Record everything,” “Full-time thief,” “Fortune teller,” “Leave no one behind,” “I fear nothing,” “I can see straight into your soul” and “Best shot in town” can all be aspect descriptions. Do not choose generic things, like “good at most thing” or “lucky”, since they will apply to everything, or be to vague to decide if they should apply to a situation. It is up to the GM to decide if an aspect is too generic.

#### Rank

Next, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an aspect represents how influential that aspect is over who you are, and will determine the modifier to your rolls. The rank will be a number between one and five, though it can later be increased even further.

#### Using your Aspect For Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an aspect’s rank, you may add the that much to your roll. In order to use this, whatever roll you are making must align with the meaning of your aspect, as approved by the GM.

For example, if you had the aspect “Leave no one behind” at rank two, and you were trying to save a friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and add 2 to a dice roll to break open the bars of the cell.

Or, for example, if you had the aspect “Arcane researcher” at rank four, you could spend four DP and add 4 to any roll that was related to or would benefit from your experience as an arcane researcher.

If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll, use the higher ranking aspect, and add half of whatever bonus you spend on the other one, rounded up. You must also spend DP equal to this additional bonus.

#### Using your Aspect For Destiny points

In contrast, if an aspect would complicate a situation, you may choose to do whatever your aspect would imply, and gain destiny points equal to the aspect’s rank. If the aspect implies you’re bad at a certain skill, this could mean choosing to fail on the skill check. If the aspect implies that you make some sort of poor decision, making that poor decision would also count. “Bum leg,” “Scatter brained,” and “Quick to draw my sword” are examples of negative aspects. If you role play a negative aspect such that it has consequences in game, then the GM will award DP. For example, if a bookstore owner accidentally insults you, and you have the aspect “Quick to draw my sword” at rank three, you would gain three DP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-owner.

Aspects can also be invoked by the GM. In this case, the GM suggests a course of action or failed skill check that aligns with your aspect. If you do not wish to oblige, you must spend destiny points equal to the rank of the aspect to not do it. Otherwise, you must comply. If you comply, you will gain DP equal to the aspect’s rank.

#### Creating your Aspects

When you create your character, create two aspects. You will gain two more from your [race](Races) and heritage and you may gain more throughout the game. You can never have more than seven aspects, and all aspects start at rank one when they are created, unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater than rank five.

When creating an aspects, it is generally a good idea to have both aspects with both positive and negative sides to them. Without any negative aspects, you have no way of gaining more destiny points, and therefore cannot spend them on aspects.

## Progress

There are six different stages of combat power you can start at in Heart Rush: Adventurer, Exemplar, Archetype, Luminary, [Hero](Heroes), and Paragon. With each stage, you have access to more combat abilities. When you first start to play, everyone should agree which stage to begin the game at. Adventurers are barely more than commoners with a desire for excitement; luminaries are incredible combatants, likely known throughout their community; and paragons are nigh-immortal; with everything else falling somewhere in between.

Depending on what you choose, you gain different abilities.

You gain all the abilities in the corresponding row, plus all of the abilities that come before it. You also begin the game with an amount of XP corresponding to what stage you start in.

### Class, Subclass, & Paragon Levels

While you will gain XP every session, you progress in stages at the GM’s discretion. In general, you should expect to graduate to the next stage around when you have an amount of total XP corresponding to the respective stage, as outlined in the table above. However, it is ultimately up to the GM. It is suggested that the GM grant the next stage when a suitably impressive combat has been won by the party. Remember that these stages only provide bonuses to combat, so they do not need to be awarded for non-combat accomplishments.

#### Adventurer

At this stage, you have no special abilities beyond those that you purchase with your XP.

#### Exemplar

When you reach the exemplar stage, you will have to choose a class, as listed in the Classes and Subclasses section. Your class will determine what role you have in combat—tanking heavy blows, dealing damage, or supporting your teammates. You are welcome to do whatever you want in combat, but your class will give you an edge in its respective role.

#### Archetype

Upon reaching the archetype stage, you will then have to choose a subclass. Each class has two subclasses, which are specializations of your class. You must choose one of them.

#### Luminary

When you reach the luminary stage, you unlock more abilities in your subclass.

#### [Hero](Heroes)

As with the luminary stage, the [hero](Heroes) stage unlocks more abilities from your subclass.

#### Paragon

Finally, upon reaching the paragon stage you will gain paragon abilities. Each time you gain a paragon level, as granted by the GM, you may choose a paragon ability from the Paragon Abilities section. You must meet the prerequisite subclass and possible talent requirements to gain the paragon level. You can gain any number of paragon levels.

## Advice

When you create your character, it can be helpful to think about certain questions. Doing so will help you better grasp who you are playing, and will allow you to play them better and more enjoyably. It’s a good idea to have some answers to the following questions, but you can also feel free to skip this step.

### What will you be known for?

This one is perhaps most important. As important as knowing who you are now, it is also important to know who you will become. What do you want to do with your life? How will you be remembered?

### What do you care about?

You need to know what matters to your character. Do you have strong beliefs about something? What are those beliefs? With strong beliefs, you are more likely to have reasons to interact with the story, so it is good to have some.

### What were you doing before?

You don’t need a full life story, but it’s a good idea to have some idea of what you were doing before the story begins. What were you doing yesterday? How about last week? Last month? Last year? Five years ago? The answers don’t need to be precise, but with more details, the GM has more material to work with for creating an immersive story.

Cleverhearts are best at providing help to their teammates—either augmenting their attacks, or debuffing enemies to make their attacks weaker.

Two types of cleverhearts exist—scoundrels and tacticians.

#### Above the Fray

_Passive ability. Exemplar._

Although not necessarily the best at dishing out the damage in a fight, supports excel at everything else. Once per turn, you may make an object interaction, skill check, disengage action, or help action for free.

#### Tactics

You can spot out the weak points in your enemies’ defenses and direct your allies towards them. Choose a creature within 30 feet. If the creature meets one of the following conditions, attacks against them have [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage). For each additional condition met, attacks against that creature are made with an additional level of [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) until the end of the round.

- Creature has a wall on two sides
- Creature is adjacent to two or more allies

# Danaki

Tags: [race](Races)

## Overview

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as the baby [minotaur](Minotaur) children are raised by the village. Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they interested in finding out. From a young age, they are taught to fight and kill, usually long before they learn how to read and write.

<br>
Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk [state](States) of anger and pure, single-minded aggression. During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring many injuries.

<br>
Danaki are trained from a young age to express very little emotion, and suppress it if possible. Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not felt those things since they were a child. Marriages in Danaki villages are arranged by the village council once each member in the union has been deemed “stable”. Most Danaki view their marriage as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing that you have completed your growth. The marriages are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.

<br>
Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to one another, they admit it only in confidence, and believe themselves capable of making decisions completely unaffected by that attachment.

# Demon Horn Of Fire

The demon horn of fire is a magic item. It was created by the god of demons after a cunning demon fire mage enslaved hundereds of [humans](Humans) (and a few other races) and sacrificed them in a volcano. Among the sacrificed were peasants and soldiers alike as well a few nobles and heroes. The souls of the sacrificed were consumed by the god of demons who then used it to create the horn of fire and gift it to the demon mage as thanks for their sevitude and worship. After watching the demon mage use the horn, the god of demons decided that it actually wanted the horn for themselves and slayed the mage in order to reclaim the horn before the mage left the valcano. The horn is considered a legendary item that can be used primarily by bards or fire mages. Playing the horn casts powerful fire spells depending on the tune or melody. Most spells favor area damage and raw power over more technical attributes but skilled musicians can force the horn to produce more elloquent spells as well. The horn responds to the music played on it but it can also convert mana of a fire user into music which allows non-bards to use the horn so long as they can channel fire-attuned mana through it. \n\n------------\n

You have developed a natural immunity to most of the toxins that can be found in swamps, and do not take damage from poisons, gasses, fumes, or venom. \n\n------------\n

# Deoric

Tags: [magic](Magic)

[Deoric](Deoric) is the language of absolute power. Statements spoken in [deoric](Deoric) have the power to rip the world apart, if anybody had the knowledge and capacity to wield the power required to do so. According to legends, this is the language the gods spoke when they created the world. Nowadays, the spoken language is nearly dead, though the written form remains alive in the runes used in handmagic, as well as forbidden rituals performed by the few left who know them.

## Hand[magic](Magic)

The amount of power required to channel [Deoric](Deoric) is immense, let alone wield it in a purposeful way. It is only through the strengthening of the astral thread binding one’s [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) that one can hope to bind the power necessary to use [Deoric](Deoric). With stronger astral thread, one’s hand can be tattooed with more runes in titan blood (or the ground up dust from titan bones, mixed into a paste) which act both as a means of holding the [magic](Magic) as well as channeling it in way described by the [Deoric](Deoric) runes. However, inscribing too many runes on one’s hand runs the risk of snapping one’s astral thread, killing the owner instantly.

Handmagic comes in two main flavors—unique abilities, and skill buffs. Both strain your astral thread, though the skill buffs are generally simpler and cheaper, as the addition in skill is usually a less complicated rune.

For players of Heart Rush, strengthening one’s astral thread takes the form of gaining XP and spending it on handmagic.

## Ritual [Magic](Magic)

Ritual [magic](Magic) is [magic](Magic) performed using [Deoric](Deoric) speech, powered by blood sacrifice. Anything is possible with ritual [magic](Magic) so long as you know the words and have a suitable amount of life sacrificed. Rules for ritual [magic](Magic) are described in below the Spells section.

## Recording [Deoric](Deoric) Text

[Deoric](Deoric) cannot be recorded except with titan blood or special ink made from their ground up bones. It is magically draining to write, due to the powerful nature of the text. Writing a rune or simple command takes about an hour to complete, and causes you to lose 10 hitpoints. You regain hitpoints lost in this way at a rate of 1 hitpoint each week.

Once [Deoric](Deoric) text is read by someone other than the author, the text disintegrates into ash. For this reason, along with the reasons above, any book of [Deoric](Deoric) text is incredibly valuable.

## [Deoric](Deoric), [Daemons](Daemons), & [Celesté](Celesté)

[Deoric](Deoric) is primarily used by the [daemons](Daemons) of [Celesté](Celesté). Having been around for centuries, millennia, or in some rare cases, eons, these beings are frequently at much higher levels of mastery with the [Deoric](Deoric) language that mortals can only dream of. By using this [magic](Magic), they serve their followers.

There are several different varieties of [magic](Magic) in [Alaria](Alaria). Each come from different sources of energy and have different properties. …\*\*

# Desert Mammoth

Tags: [monster](Monsters)

Very docile. Huge, camel-furred mammoths. Tusks, trunks. Eat lichen in the [Copper Hills](Copper Hills).\n\n------------\n

# Desert of One Million Shards

Tags: [desert](Deserts)

This [desert](Deserts) was created when a massive meteor struck a [desert](Deserts) oasis kingdom. In a last ditch effort to avert the collision, powerful fire mages transfered the heat from the explosion to the rest of the [desert](Deserts). Although the oasis city was still destroyed, the meteor was not as cataclysmic. However, the distributed heat melted the [desert](Deserts), turning it to glass.

Over the millenia, this glass has been sandblasted and fractured—resulting in some places being blanketed in huge swaths of glass fragments.

[Rocs](Rocs) in the nearby mountains now hunt large prey by lifting them up into the sky, and dropping them on the [desert](Deserts) to break their bones before bringing them back to their enormous nests in the mountains.\n\n------------\n

# Deva

Tags: [race](Races), supernatural

Deva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very commanding presences that enter the world fully grown, intelligent, with no family, and a single, driving purpose. Several explanation exist on how they appear, though the most supported reasoning is that they are manifestations of collective thought and hope from the Psyic plane.

Deva generally have light, gray, blueish, lavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their eyes, which are pure white. They are on average, slightly taller than [humans](Humans), though only slightly. Deva rarely appear looking younger than in their twenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although it does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and in combination with their striking features, they are generally at the center of attention of any room they enter.

Deva are always “born” with a deep feeling of hope and purpose. The source of that hope and purpose is never clear, but the force with which these drive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that goal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are usually somewhat noble, such as “freeing the [region](Regions) from tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat” or “leading their community safely to a new land”. These purposes tend to align with the communities in which they spawn, supporting theories of their psyic origins.

Deva also are born with a feeling of having memories that are not entirely their own. They do not know how they know so many skills, as they remember nothing of learning them. They may have faint memories of past events within their communities, or even past experiences of other deva before them, but beyond that, it feels as though their lives began when they spawned.

When a deva dies, their body dissipates—there is no body left over. If they failed at their purpose, another deva may appear years later, or if they succeeded, another deva might not appear for hundreds of years.

The psyic energy from which you spawned occasionally provides imagery from others’ memories of the past as well, guiding you when you face difficult challenges. You may use this ability to gain [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) on any skill check you make. If the skill check also aligns with your deeper purpose, you instead gain A3.

You also do not have a [soul](Life and Death) or [shadow](Life and Death), and are thus invisible on both the ethereal and nethereal planes. This also excludes you from effects on creatures with souls or shadows.\n\n------------\n

Drachma have black eyes and a second eyelid, similar to fish, allowing them to see perfectly clearly underwater.

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous, and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and following ones instincts. They are usually the first one you notice when walking into a room—both for their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities. It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.

Drachma are generally found in western regions of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their hearty Drachman ale.

The Erzqin also patrol the waters, slaying and destroying those who dare to enter.\n\n------------\n

# Dragons

Tags: [monster](Monsters)

[Dragons](Dragons) are enormously powerful, anomolous creatures, with mysterious motivations and indefinite lifetimes. There are many different types of [dragons](Dragons), as they have been around for over 100 million years.

Although [dragons](Dragons) are not immortal, they will never die of natural causes, and will frequently age to be thousands, or sometimes millions of years old. For this reason, [dragons](Dragons) have incomparable patience, and will pursue sometimes strange and nonsensical goals purely in the [spirit](Life and Death) of "because why not". This also leads many [dragons](Dragons) down a path of vicious cruelty, where the only way left to amuse oneself is the torture and suffering of others.

# History

This was erased, and I don't want to write it again :(, but the gist is that they used to be super powerful until other [races](Races) arrived, in which case they are still powerful, but less dominant over the world.

# Types of [Dragons](Dragons)

The following is a list of the different types of [dragons](Dragons). Not all [dragons](Dragons) fit into their stereotype, but since a dragon's form changes over time to match its capabilities and personality, it's usually a good measuring stick.

**Black Dragons**

# Drasnian

Tags: [Dwarves](Dwarves)

# Overview

Drasnian [dwarves](Dwarves) are the eldest and by far most populous of the [dwarven](Dwarves) heritages, dating back to before the Uline [dwarves](Dwarves) went underground. Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with softer features than their other [dwarven](Dwarves) cousins, and live almost exclusively above ground or in homes built into hillsides. They have a long history of both prosperity and destitution, and through economic trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement, have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as in several countries where Drasnians have settled down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the believed birthplace of the Drasnians.

As a whole, they value education, money, and preserving their cultural and religious legacy. Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating worship, relationships, and one’s day-to-day life.

They were alive before gaea, and still survive today (though in vastly fewer numbers).

Everything about them is grace. Merely looking at one causes shivers to go down one's spine. They are the epitome of beauty, wisdom, and grace. Looking into a druid's eyes results in being charmed.

Half-goblin, half-dwarf, and hated by both equally. Staunch, hearty, chaotic, wise, strong, and friendly, there's not much to dislike. However, both goblins and [dwarves](Dwarves) view Dwarblin as a disgusting, mutt-race, filthy and tainted by the other [race](Races).

Green skin, beards, strong, and a bit shorter and more sinewy than a typical [dwarf](Dwarves). Fantastic tradesmen, good eye for valuables, and capable craftsmen.

Dwarblin merchants peddling wares at the sea, while dwarblins in the mountains mine the earth. Not very magical, but good with their hands.\n\n------------\n

## Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Magocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Echi ([Goshwen](Goshwen))

**Population**: 150,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Knowledge, scholarship, magical prowess, elemental control, skill

- [Echea](Echea) is controlled by a combination of scholars and elemental masters in a large council. Access is granted by a combination of invitation and majority vote from general population.
- [Echea](Echea) is largely a meritocracy. If you are smart, you are respected by your peers.
- Elemental [magic](Magic) is largely valued, as is technical skill. Although the Echi hate the [Cogheads](Cogheads), they begrudgingly respect their skill.

## Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very developed

**Primary Exports**: Magitech, education

**Primary Imports**:

- [Echea](Echea) is home to some of the largest, most influential universities in all of [Alaria](Alaria). If you wish to master an element, many choose to come to the Echean universities.
  - They have paragon attuned elementalists within every discipline.
    - The universities also require you to work on artifacts part time. These are sold and help fund the university.
- [Echea](Echea) exports a high quantity of magical imbued artifacts, bringing in large quantities of wealth.

## Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Extremely high

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Echean military rarely forms, but when it does, it is absolutely terrifying. The universities double as military training academies, and citizens who attend them are required to also take classes in military tactics and combat. This results in highly capable, extremely talented elemental war casters making up the majority of the Echean military forces.

## Primary Conflicts

- [Echea](Echea) is frequently the trophy of military endeavors, since it is seen as a wellspring of wealth and education to be harnessed. However, invaders have never made it to the capital.
- [Echea](Echea) houses many children of foreign royalty who wish to see some of the knowledge of the Echean universities rub off on their offspring, with variable success.
- Despite hundreds of years passing, the vicious hatred between Echeans and [Cogheads](Cogheads) continues. Echea conveniently ignores the Coghead genocide only 50 years ago that killed all the cogheads in echea.
- A mad scientist scholar hypothesized about the existance of a flip site of the [Material Plane](Material Plane). Unbeknownst to anyone else, he managed to open a portal to the other side, binding the entire city of [Adi Assabehta](Adi Assabehta) to [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus). Now, people are mysteriously dying throughout the city, and some people are fleeing. Many people don't think this mysterious death thing is real (or think it's caused by other reasons), so most stay. The scholar was the first to die (freak coincidence), and no one suspects anything. Portal undiscovered. The capital will slowly empty out over the next few years as people realize that there is something causing people to mysteriously die.

## History

Two centuries ago, [Cogheads](Cogheads) and Echi worked together in the mountains. The [cogheads](Cogheads) created the machinery, and the Echi created the [magic](Magic). The mountains were jointly ruled over by the two [races](Races). A friendly, but fierce rivarly between the two [races](Races) existed over which technology was better—[magic](Magic) or machines. The Echi declared victory when they had created infinite resources from their elemental artifacts, but the [Cogheads](Cogheads) countered by developing a machine allowing them to steal the very elemental attunement out of another creature's body. They used this to say that they had in fact won. Of course, this was disputed by the [gnomes](Gnomes). In retaliation, the [cogheads](Cogheads) sucked the extremely potent elemental attunement right out of a Echi figurehead. This was seen as an act of war, and the Echi massacred and drove the [Cogheads](Cogheads) out of the mountains. The [Cogheads](Cogheads) have never forgiven the Echi for the brutal massacre, and the Echi believe it was totally justified. This conflict has spread across ethnic lines, and many [gnomes](Gnomes) and [goblins](Goblins) who had nothing to do with the history now have variably extreme views towards the other.

# Einwissel

Tags: [race](Races)

## Overview

Founded by the small colony of [dwarves](Dwarves) who traversed from [Celesté](Celesté) back to the [material plane](Material Plane). They are more in touch with the [daemons](Daemons), and they are capable of wielding each other's thoughts for [magic](Magic), but fragments of their true names are still known, putting them at enormous risk. For this reason, few [Einwissel](Einwissel) ever leave their colony, hidden deep within the mountains.

Live in the [Zhorheim Mountains](Zhorheim Mountains) and [Mountains of Miphoris](Mountains of Miphoris).

## Physical Appearance

The Eiwissel have blue-gray skin with silvery speckles in it. They are generally not as strong as the [Uline](Uline), though they are equally tall.

## Cultural Overview

The [Einwissel](Einwissel) are as rare as the lichen they are named after, and have a shyness to match. Little is known about their culture, though they are believed to hold on to some of the strict matriarchal traditions they had when they left the [material plane](Material Plane) millenia ago.

# Elemental Planes

Tags: [planes](Planes)

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material [planes](Planes) (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial [planes](Planes) (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material [planes](Planes). The layers closer to the material [planes](Planes) are more accessible to those on the material [planes](Planes), whereas the elemental layers closer to [Celesté](Celesté) and the other immaterial [planes](Planes) are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

[Leylines](Leylines) are cracks in the [planes](Planes) where individual elemental [planes](Planes) spill through much closer to the [material plane](Material Plane). Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental [magic](Magic) performed on leylines is always more fantastic.

Those layers are:

- [Yolus](Yolus) (Fire)
- [Sulus](Sulus) (Air)
- [Golus](Golus) (Earth)
- [Pelus](Pelus) (Water)
- [Vulus](Vulus) (Darkness)
- [Kunus](Kunus) (Light)
- [Nilus](Nilus) (Void)
- [Izzus](Izzus) (Time)

Along certain lines across the land, these [elemental planes](Elemental Planes) bend much closer to the [Material Plane](Material Plane). Those lines on which they bend closer are known as Leylines, and are locations where elemental [magic](Magic) relying on the corresponding element will be much more potent.

# Enymu

Tags: [state](States)

Enymu is a nation inhabited primarily by humans, located to the east of Nektuna and partially separated by the mysterious Stone Forest. Unlike its wealthier neighbor, Enymu lacks access to leylines and a stronghold on trade, leading to a relatively poorer economy. However, it sustains itself through agriculture and trade, primarily exporting grains, vegetables, and livestock.

The capital, Zaru, sits at the mouth of the Shekal River, which flows into the Tarkhon Strait, an important trading route controlled by Nektuna. Despite its challenges, Zaru is a vibrant city where the traditions of the monarchy are upheld, ruled by a long line of honorable kings. These rulers, although well-meaning, have often been viewed as naive, leading to indecision in matters of state.

To the south, Enymu controls Midton Island, which lies centrally in the Tarkhon Strait and features the coastal fort Ekfusy. This fort serves as a first line of defense against potential incursions from Nektuna or opportunistic pirates seeking to exploit the region.

The nation has a rich history, with communities built on cooperation and a deep respect for the land. However, there is an undercurrent of dissent among some factions that believe a more aggressive stance towards Nektuna could improve their fortunes.

While Enymu's loyalty to the monarchy runs deep, the possibility of a shift in allegiances lingers in the air. The kingdom may be persuaded to turn on Nektuna if it can be shown that such an alliance would serve their interests better than the current situation.

Over the years, Enymu has faced economic struggles, skirmishes with banditry, and the ongoing challenge of maintaining its identity in a world dominated by wealthier states. The balance of power remains delicate, with the potential for change always lurking just beneath the surface.

## Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Monarchy

Enymu is ruled by a long line of kings who are generally considered honorable but somewhat naive. The monarchy maintains traditions and seeks to uphold the welfare of its people, though this can lead to indecisiveness in times of crisis.

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

The population is primarily human.

**Population**: Approximately 400,000

Enymu has a similar population to Nektuna but lacks the economic wealth to support a lavish lifestyle for its citizens. The people are mostly farmers and traders, living in rural communities as well as urban centers.

**Stability**: Moderately stable

While the monarchy enjoys support among the populace, internal dissent can arise due to economic struggles and occasional disputes with neighboring regions. The lack of significant military power makes the nation vulnerable to external threats.

**Core Values**:

- Honor and tradition
- Community and cooperation
- Agricultural prosperity
- Reluctance to engage in conflict

## Economy

**Size**: Moderate, primarily agriculture-based

Enymu’s economy is rooted in agriculture, with vast fields of crops and livestock farming. Trade, while decent, does not match the scale of Nektuna’s wealth, leading to economic challenges.

**Tech**: Basic agricultural technology with some trade advancements

While Enymu lacks advanced technology, it employs traditional farming methods alongside simple innovations to improve crop yields. The nation does benefit from some trade tools, enhancing their ability to export goods.

**Primary Exports**:

- Grains and vegetables
- Livestock, particularly sheep and cattle
- Herbal remedies and tinctures, often made by the Craven
- Handcrafted goods, including textiles and pottery

**Primary Imports**:

- Luxury items, such as silks and spices from Nektuna
- Tools and machinery to improve agricultural efficiency
- Magical components for minor enchantments and agriculture

## Military

**Size**: Approximately 20,000 active troops

The military is relatively small and primarily focused on local defense. Enymu relies on a citizen militia for protection, with the standing army serving to maintain order rather than engage in external conflicts.

**Quality**: Average, with a focus on defensive tactics

The troops are well-trained in defensive strategies but lack the resources and training to compete with larger military forces. The Craven often contribute unique combat techniques based on agility and deception.

**Enrollment**: Voluntary, often due to patriotism

Citizens are encouraged to enlist in the military, motivated by a sense of duty to protect their homeland. However, many prefer to focus on farming or trade, leading to fluctuations in troop levels.

## [Geography](Geography)

**Location**: Eastern region, partially split from Nektuna by the Stone Forest

Enymu is strategically positioned to the east of Nektuna, bordered by the Stone Forest, a mystical and dense wood known for its ancient trees and magical properties.

**Biomes**:

- Fertile plains ideal for agriculture
- Dense forests in the northern region (Stone Forest)
- Coastal areas along the Shekal River and Tarkhon Strait

**Named Entities**: Zaru, Midton Island, Ekfusy

Zaru, the capital, is a bustling port city at the mouth of the Shekal River, while Midton Island features the fort Ekfusy, crucial for coastal defense.

**Rivers & Lakes**:

- Shekal River, vital for trade and agriculture, flowing south into the Tarkhon Strait
- Minor lakes and tributaries provide additional irrigation for farmlands

**Adjacent Waters**: Tarkhon Strait

The strait is a crucial trade route, with Enymu relying on it for the export of its agricultural goods.

## Political [Geography](Geography)

**Capital**: Zaru

Zaru serves as the political and economic center of Enymu, with a vibrant marketplace and a royal palace that reflects the nation’s traditions.

**Cities**:

**Towns**:

**Villages**:

## Primary Conflicts

- **Economic Rivalry with Nektuna**: Enymu feels the pressure of competing with Nektuna’s wealth, leading to tension over trade agreements.
- **Territorial Disputes**: The presence of Craven factions can cause friction between the inhabitants, particularly regarding land and resources.
- **Potential Alliance with Nektuna**: While some factions may be persuaded to ally with Nektuna, deep-rooted loyalty to the monarchy complicates potential betrayals.
- **Threats from Banditry**: The lack of a strong military presence can lead to bandit raids in rural areas, creating fear and instability.

- Working in the military is seen as a job for idiots who can't turn a profit on their own.
- As tensions heat up between [Anarak](Anarak) and [Myorna](Myorna), [Erasnus](Erasnus) is scrambling to not get swallowed up if war should break out.
- The population is largely non-violent. If threatened with a sharp stick, most Erasnuns would throw up their hands and give over all of their money. Most see it as much easier to trade to make money rather than risk getting hurt stealing.

- The military is largely disrespected, but those at the head of it do control a considerable amount of power, which they could wield to wrestle some control from the nobility and merchants, who have scorned them forever.

# Overview

longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every [goblin](Goblins) is born with an attunement to one of those elements.

The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.

Etherweaver bloodline pops up randomly in [goblin](Goblins) broods. It "overrides" typical [goblin](Goblins) features. Sometimes they are killed for being different, while other times they are held in great importance as a rarity.

Large density in [Yuki](Yuki), tho this random bloodline has popped up all over Alaria.

The Ezuri, or “tree people” as it translates to from Old [Gnomish](Gnomes), stemmed from when Mad Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the [forest](Forests) dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters. While many fled the [jungle](Jungles), some were trapped, and forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty places.

The Ezuri also value connection with each other as well as the natural world around them, and are taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a young age. This, combined with their natural affinity for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger humanoids across Alaria.

[Ghosts](Ghosts) and [shades](Shades) don't leave the Astral and Malstaric [planes](Planes) because of the high, planar forces pushing souls up and shadows down. Without thread binding them together, they do not cancel out. They also lack the free will to desire to return to the [material plane](Material Plane).
\n\n------------\n

# Ghouls

Tags: [race](Races)

Ghouls are the descendants of servants spawned by ancient, powerful wizards. They were created as butlers, maids, and test subjects, fabricated from the combination of Deoric ritual and a body of the recently deceased, made to serve the wizards. Because of this, ghouls lack any [spirit](Life and Death), making them immune to some effects, but incredibly susceptible to [Kethic](Kethic Elementalism) elemental magic. They exert no [Kethic](Kethic Elementalism) presence, meaning there’s nothing stopping a water attuned mage from filling a ghoul’s lungs with water, or a fire attuned mage from igniting the very skin of a [ghoul](Ghouls).

After the age of great Deoric mages ended, ghouls lived on. They are rare, and not infrequently killed for their distinctive, gaunt, gray skin that identifies them as ghouls, an aspect that many try to cover up. This widely felt vehemence towards ghouls stems from the belief that they kill other humanoids and eat them—which is partially true.

Due to the nature of ghouls’ origin, they feel an eternal emptiness within their bodies that aches to be filled. Eating magic, and the souls of other living things sate that hunger. While eating magic and flesh are not strictly necessary for [ghoul](Ghouls) survival, it usually feels that way, and any chance to eat magic or the recently deceased has a powerful frenzying effect on all ghouls. Many give in to this urge, feeling little sympathy towards a world that has given them nothing but hurt, creating a reputation for all ghouls of hunting and eating [humans](Humans). Seeing a [ghoul](Ghouls) in a feeding frenzy is a truly horrifying experience—one that only needs to be seen once before never wanting to be near another [ghoul](Ghouls) again.

For these reasons, [ghoul](Ghouls) hunters can be found across Alaria. Nearly all are mages—capable of killing a [ghoul](Ghouls) in nearly an instant. While some ghouls try to flee or hide from the hunters, others fight back, usually gathering in small groups in the hopes of overwhelming the hunter.
Despite not being able to create biological offspring, some ghouls will create other ghouls, using the same cruel magic as was used to create the original few. The Deoric ritual is innately known by all ghouls, and requires nothing more than one dead body, and one live one for sacrifice. This ritual takes 1 hour to perform.

#### [Soul](Life and Death) Eater

_Passive ability._

When you are adjacent to a [humanoid](Humans) or creature of greater power that has died within the last hour, you may spend an action to suck its [soul](Life and Death) out and ingest it. Doing so lets you heal, learn something about the creature, gain temporary magical power, or temporarily store its [soul](Life and Death) in your body to protect you from elemental magic.

When you ingest a creature’s [soul](Life and Death), choose one from the following list.

- Replenish. Regain 5 hp and any conditions affecting you.
- Inspect. The GM must tell you one secret about this creature’s past life.
- Devour. If the creature had an ability die higher than your own, you may replace your ability die with their ability die for the next ten minutes.
- Infuse. For the next 1d10 days, spelltouched cannot use their action to inflict wounds upon you, as detailed in the Deoric Origins ability described below.

While flesh is a preferred substitute for standard food, you can still consume normal foodstuffs for nutrients.

Gaining oath talents and their destiny levels cost 2 XP less.

As an action, someone with a basic attunement may inflict a wound on you, so long as you are within 45 feet.

With a paragon level attunement, they may inflict three wounds instead, and the range increases to 120 feet.

# Gnomes

Tags: [race](Races)

## Overview

[Gnomes](Gnomes) are generally known for their natural affinity to [Deoric](Deoric) [magic](Magic). They are usually quite clever, and use this to their [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) to become great merchants, diplomats, and inventers.

Gnomes are small, naturally magical creatures, resembling miniature [humans](Humans). They range in height from two to three feet, and are frequently quite slender and nimble. [Gnomish](Gnomes) adventurers are generally more magically adept than hearty, and will often have entire sleeves of handmagic tattoos stretching up their arms.

In general, [gnomes](Gnomes) are a bit over three feet, have slightly larger than proportional heads and are usually somewhat slender.

# Goblins

Tags: [race](Races)

# Overview

[Goblins](Goblins) grow up in large broods, all born of a single father. The size of these broods vary from group to group, but they can range from 10 to nearly 1000. [Goblins](Goblins) will usually grow up with many of their siblings, working with them to achieve the goals of the colony.

[Goblins](Goblins) are born in broods, from a single father and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father may sire thousands of [goblin](Goblins) children, who are all raised together, with no knowledge of their specific mother. The brood-father, over the course of his lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen, who will mother the next brood-father—the first born son.

Most [goblins](Goblins) live in communities around a single [goblin](Goblins) lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and friends are one’s half-siblings. This can lead to bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict. Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie that many [goblins](Goblins) feel towards their brood-mates.

[Goblins](Goblins) are roughly the height of [gnomes](Gnomes), but usually slightly stronger. Many have a greenish tint to their skin, but [goblins](Goblins) like [Ruddings](Ruddings) and [Red Devils](Red Devils) have redder skin, and Blitzlings have blueish skin.

# Goshwen

Tags: [race](Races)

# Overview

If there is one thing that can be said abut Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get into trouble all the time—but they are definitely clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves, merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons. While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and competent.

Goshwen’s culture of openness and constant change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of their communities. This has given rise to many different branches of Goshwen communities across Alaria with different quirks and identities. However, all of them maintain their appreciation for progress and wit.

# How to use the wiki

# Simple markdown

To see al the markdown syntax you can visit the [markdown cheatsheet](/Markdown%20cheatsheet)

# [Homepage](homepage)

The [homepage](homepage) is default the "homepage.md" file, this can't be changed. If this file doesn't exist create it in de wiki folder.

# Static images

If you have images that you don't want to be available on the internet, you can put them inside the folder **"static/images/"** for example **"testfile.png"**, now you can link to **"/static/images/testfile.png"**

# Latex

It's possible to use latex syntax inside your markdown because the markdown is first converted to latex and after that to html. This means you have a lot more flexibility.

# Kerwin

Tags: [state](States)

## Overview

Home to agrarian halflings. Very relaxing country, pretty despite being quite arid. Decent art, very kind people. Like hobbits.

However, ruled over by [Ulyas, the Immortal], the 898 year old [halfling](Halflings) king. They are certainly a lich, though nobody knows where he gets his spirits from—they believe that his yearly trip to <some poi> replenishes his health. In actuality, involves large sacrifice to keep him alive. He is a good king, so believes it's justifiable.

Kerwin is a mountainous region known for its rich mineral deposits and skilled craftsmen. As a subsidiary state of the Tarkhon Empire, it maintains a degree of autonomy while benefiting from the empire's protection and trade networks.

## Government & Peoples

- **Government Type**: Monarchy
- **Primary Inhabitants**: Halflings
- **Population**: Approximately 200,000
- **Stability**: Stable, though rumors of anomalies and deterioration of Ulyas' health has led to whispers of a new successor.
- **Core Values**: Craftsmanship, Honor, Tradition, and Resource Management

## Economy

- **Size**: Moderate, focused on mining and metalworking
- **Tech**: Advanced in mining and metallurgy
- **Primary Exports**: Precious metals, gems, finely crafted weapons and armor
- **Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, and luxury goods

## History

Kerwin joined the Tarkhon Empire voluntarily, seeing the benefits of protection and expanded trade. However, it maintains a strong sense of cultural identity and takes pride in its contributions to the empire's strength.\n\n------------\n

# Kethic Elementalism

Tags: [magic](Magic)

[Kethic elementalism](Kethic Elementalism), or simply [Kethic](Kethic Elementalism), is one of the most prevalent systems of [magic](Magic). Its basis is in one of attunements. By understanding a fundamental element completely, and having a primal bond with that thing, one can develop power to control that element. As that bond and understanding grows, one’s power over that element grows.

There are nine fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With these elements, nearly everything is created. Many things are compounds of these elements, while others, such as living things, have additional, non-elemental components.

By attuning to different elements, you have some basic power over those elements. There are three different levels of attunement for each basic element, and one level for each secondary element—each of which grant you various abilities.

However, attuning to an element is difficult. Most people never attune to any elements in their life times, and your [spirit](Life and Death) must be able to handle the additional pressure of resonating with the your attuned element. Those who do will frequently do so by accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to one of these such elements. More advanced attunements require even more exposure, and paragon level attunements generally require special activity dedicated to developing an attunement to that element.

[Kethic](Kethic Elementalism) also comes with limitations. Every living thing has some very low level attunement with all the elements, and for this reason, it is nearly impossible for another creature to interfere with elements especially close to another living being, such as its blood or flesh.

# Krell Lands

Tags: [jungle](Jungles)

The [Krell](Krell) Lands are a collosal, [Krell](Krell) infested [jungle](Jungles). Civilizations once thrived in these [Jungles](Jungles), but upon the arrival of the [Krell](Krell), the entire south-eastern section of the continent has been covered with the insects.

\n\n------------\n

# Krell

Tags: monter

Krell live in enormous colonies worshipping a single queen. Once every few centuries, the queen will lay a series of eggs that will hatch to become princesses. These princesses are trained and brought up in court for 50 years before battling to the death. The final survivor chooses from a large selection of suitors, and then takes him and a retinue of soldiers and travels some distance away from the colony. This migration is called a swarming. Upon arrival, the new queen mates with the suitor, and then kills him. In the new location, they exterminate all competition in the area and beginning a new colony, and the queen proceeds to lay more eggs until the colony is up to size once more.

While a single krell is nothing to be scared of, when the hive swarms, nothing can stand in their way. Entire settlements have been known to disappear after a new hive settles nearby. Hives eventually die when the queen passes away, opening the [region](Regions) for settlement by others once again. However, there is no knowing when the hive will return.

Perhaps even more terrifying is when two hive bloodlines go to war. Casualties range in the thousands, and the clouds of vultures and crows in the will leave the skies dark for days after.

Krell culture is complex and nuanced, founded on a system of pheromones, antennae movements, and footsteps that outsiders bare little chance of understanding. While they have vocal chords, they are short, and raspy, and they prefer not to use them.

# Deoric: The Language of Absolutes

[Deoric](Deoric) was once spoken by the titans who long ago inhabited [Alaria](Alaria).

The language is extremely complex, and takes centuries to learn, but unlocks great power.

This power comes from spiritual sacrifice, usually by killing a sentient creature and performing a ritual. \n\n------------\n

The hosts will seek out company and try to bite them, thereby transfering the worm-eggs to a new host through the saliva. They can be seen frequently licking their hands and fingers, which they use to scratch people.\n\n------------\n

# Liches

A lich is a being that has split its [spirit](Life and Death) in two, and usually, is using another being’s [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) to remain alive. By binding a piece of its [spirit](Life and Death) to an object, it can survive death by transferring to the [spirit](Life and Death) saved in the object. This has the effect of fragmenting the [spirit](Life and Death) more and more times with subsequent deaths, causing the lich to fade more and more from any sense of humanity. On top of this, the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) must be replenished with each new iteration, usually requiring taking the life of another being of similar strength.

# Life and Death

A creature’s life is dictated by the health and union of their [soul](Life and Death), [shadow](Life and Death), and [spirit](Life and Death). At the center of their being is their [spirit](Life and Death), which is the spark of free will and personality that defines who they are. Wrapped on either side are the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death), the astral and malstaric counterbalances of the [spirit](Life and Death), which together give life and movement to the [spirit](Life and Death) they are bound to. While still critical to life, they do not define who the person is.

### The [Soul](Life and Death)

The soul is made of pure positive energy from [Aurus, the White Sun](Aurus, the White Sun). A long, faint strand of it stretches all the way back to the sun. It was created by [Aurus](Aurus, the White Sun). Only Alarian creatures are energized with a soul.

### The [Shadow](Life and Death)

The shadow is made of pure negative energy from [Nydus, the Black Sun](Nydus, the Black Sun). A long, faint strand of it stretches all the way back to the sun. It was created by [Nydus](Nydus, the Black Sun). Only Alarian creatures are energized with a shadow.

### The [Spirit](Life and Death)

One's [spirit](Life and Death) is made of pure ezz, pulled from the swirling mass throughout the planes. Living things with both thought and emotion all have some spirit-like core consisting mainly of ezz. Life-like things from other planar stacks may not have emotion, and will be "powered" by something other than a soul and shadow. For example, some life on other planar stacks is powered with [Aether](Aether).

## Astral & Malstaric Thread

Binding the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) to the [spirit](Life and Death) is a creature’s astral and malstaric thread. If this thread is broken, the creature dies, and their newly freed [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) float up and sink down to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) and [Malstaris](Malstaris) respectively, while their [spirit](Life and Death) fades to [Celesté](Celesté).

If the thread is not broken but still damaged, it can nevertheless have serious effects on the life of that being. It can make one weaker to effects that would dominate ones [spirit](Life and Death), and having part of the thread break completely could cause your [soul](Life and Death) or [shadow](Life and Death) to leave completely, sapping one of most of their life and energy.

If a creature is missing its [soul](Life and Death) or [shadow](Life and Death), its defenses against [Deoric](Deoric) [magic](Magic) are drastically weakened, and makes it susceptible to death, mind control, or anything else the caster desires.

## Beings In Between

Various names are given to the creatures with different combinations of [soul](Life and Death), [shadow](Life and Death), and [spirit](Life and Death).

- [Revenants](Revenants)
- [Ghosts](Ghosts)
- [Shades](Shades)
- [Undead](Undead)

Tags: [race](Races)

## Overview

While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the commanding general for a king’s army. In describing the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most famously quoted that “Lorean think with their head, not with their horns”. Of course, if you ask their spouses, they will say that they “think with their head, not with their hearts”. This is the cursed blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded, but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems in any other way.

<br>
Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on education and sound decision making. To make a mistake because emotions clouded one’s judgement is worthy of profound shame. It’s not that Lorean don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them influence one’s decision at all is weakness and failure, especially when other people’s wellbeing is at stake.

<br>
This sense of duty towards protection lies as deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been placed in charge of his troop will die before letting his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the ultimate failure as a [minotaur](Minotaur)—worthy of self-exile. Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to such high standards, including other [minotaur](Minotaur), every  Lorean would never give such leniency to themselves.

Primarily reside in Keletus.

# Magic

# Magic Systems of the World

Magic in this world stems from various origins, each with its own rules, sources, and limitations. These can be broadly categorized into three types: **Old Magic**, **Spirit Magic**, and **Avatar Magic**. Each has a distinct source, nature, and historical context, influencing how societies and cultures view and use them.

---

## Old Magic

Old Magic is the original form of magic, created by the primordial gods **Azus** and **Melera**. It is known for its immense, almost infinite power, but also for its complexity and difficulty in learning. Mastering Old Magic is a rare feat, reserved for the most devoted practitioners who are willing to dedicate their lives to understanding its nuances. There are three main subtypes of Old Magic:

### Azyen Magic

- **Source**: Power from Azus, one of the old gods, who embodies individualism, patterns, and logic.
- **Nature**: The magic is seemingly random but relies on learning a precise pattern of thoughts. Practitioners must train their minds to replicate a complex, delicate sequence—like a mental form of dance or meditation. Mastering Azyen Magic involves clearing one’s thoughts and then following a strict mental pathway, much like memorizing an impossibly intricate melody.
- **Usage**: Extremely versatile, but hard to control. Practitioners, known as **Magi**, must learn to think like Azus, and even a minor deviation in the sequence can disrupt the spell.
- **Challenges**: Learning to manipulate Azyen Magic is akin to mastering an impossibly difficult instrument—one wrong move, and the magic can unravel.

### Gaeic Magic

- **Source**: Melera, one of the old gods, who embodies harmony, change, and emotion.
- **Nature**: Practitioners sing or play melodies that resonate with Melera’s power. It is infinite but requires deep emotional connection and understanding. The magic flows naturally, but only when the caster aligns their intentions with Melera’s will. This type of magic is fluid, almost alive, and reacts unpredictably if not handled correctly.
- **Usage**: Gaeic magic is most commonly used in rituals, blessings, and nature spells. Those attuned to it, called **True Bards**, can do nearly anything, but only in ways that follow the same sort of strange logic of Melera.
- **Challenges**: The spells often work only if they align with Melera’s vision. Forcing the magic to act against this flow can lead to disastrous consequences, making it unreliable for those with ulterior motives.

### Creature Magic

- **Source**: Creatures born with innate magical abilities that derive from Old Magic.
- **Nature**: Some beings, by their very existence, embody the magic of Azus or Melera. This is seen not as “learned” magic but as a natural trait, similar to how some species have enhanced longevity or strength. For example, a creature might innately know Azyen Magic’s patterns or naturally resonate with Gaeic melodies.
- **Usage**: This magic is automatic, integrated into the creature’s being. It’s not something they control consciously, but rather an aspect of their nature, like an elf’s longer lifespan or a dragon’s breath.
- **Challenges**: Because it is inherent, creature magic cannot be taught or transferred. It is simply part of the creature’s essence.

---

## Spirit Magic

Spirit Magic operates by channeling energy from spirits, often through rites or invocations. Unlike Old Magic, Spirit Magic has roots in the mortal world, born out of the need to harness power from beyond the physical realm. It can be viewed as a more accessible form of magic, though not without its ethical and practical concerns.

### Deoric Magic

- **Source**: Magic drawn from the practitioner’s own life energy, or forcibly taken from others.
- **Nature**: A dark, forbidden form of magic, developed independently from the gods. It involves sacrificing one’s own reserves of energy, or in darker practices, the life force of others. It has a bad reputation, often referred to by critics as “speaking in blood-verse” due to the cruel practices associated with its rituals.
- **Usage**: Practitioners, or **Deorics**, can perform powerful spells, but at a high cost. It is common in the darker corners of society, where magic-users are willing to trade life for power.
- **Challenges**: The use of Deoric Magic requires intense focus and willpower, as it drains the caster. It is also a controversial practice, banned in many regions due to its association with blood magic and sacrifice.

### Handmagic

- **Source**: Draws from the regenerative life force of ancient titans, inscribed through Deoric runes with titan blood and bones.
- **Nature**: A specific type of Deoric Magic, involving the tattooing of runes into the caster’s body. These runes tap into the power of long-dead titans, granting all varieties of magic ability.
- **Usage**: Handmagic is used by nearly anyone who can afford it.
- **Challenges**: The process of getting a tattoo is painful, and if the strength of your spirit cannot contain the titan's magic, you will perish.

### Divine Magic

- **Source**: Spiritual energy collected from prayers and devotion, combined with Deoric practices.
- **Nature**: Unlike the darker forms of Deoric, Divine Magic is considered benevolent. It collects fragments of spirit energy given freely through prayer, which are then used by gods in combination with Deoric methods. Since it is a voluntary exchange, it lacks the cruelty associated with other spirit-based magics.
- **Usage**: Gods, priests, and holy figures use Divine Magic to do whatever they want. Because the energy comes from willing devotees, the magic is seen as a gift from the gods, rather than a forced exchange.
- **Challenges**: The power of Divine Magic is tied to the faith and devotion of followers. A god with fewer followers will have less energy to work with, limiting the scope of spells.

---

## Avatar Magic

Avatar Magic involves interacting with other planes of existence, channeling energies and entities from these dimensions. Practitioners serve as conduits between the material world and other realms, giving them access to powers that ordinary mortals cannot touch.

### Kethic Elementalism

- **Source**: Elemental planes that represent fire, water, earth, air, and other natural elements.
- **Nature**: Practitioners, known as **avatars**, attune themselves to the elements, allowing them to bend, shape, and manipulate these forces. It is the most direct and physical form of magic, often requiring the user to channel their own physical energy into spells.
- **Usage**: Elementalism is used for combat, construction, and even agriculture, depending on the elements being controlled. Some avatars specialize in a single element, while others can manipulate multiple, though this is rare.
- **Challenges**: Attuning to an element requires a deep, spiritual connection, and intense concentration. It can take years of proximity to an element to build an attuenement to it, and years more to master it.

### Psyic Magic

- **Source**: Psywinds—currents of thought energy flowing through all beings.
- **Nature**: Psyic Magic allows users to interact with the thoughts of others. This can manifest as telepathy, mind-reading, or even manipulation of memories. Practitioners, known as **syncopaths**, must learn to navigate the delicate web of thoughts without causing harm.
- **Usage**: Commonly used by diplomats, spies, and healers. It can help resolve conflicts or bring peace to troubled minds, though it is just as often used for subterfuge and control.
- **Challenges**: The mental strain of navigating others’ thoughts can be overwhelming, and other people's thoughts can influence your own when you open your mind to the winds.

### Fae Magic

- **Source**: Faesong—resonant energy that taps into the emotions of living beings.
- **Nature**: This magic allows users to interact with the feelings of others, enhancing, dampening, or even creating emotions. Like Psyic Magic, it requires a delicate touch, but it focuses more on the heart than the mind. Practitioners, also called **syncopates**, are trained to use their own emotional state as a tuning fork to harmonize with others.
- **Usage**: Fae Magic is often seen in performances, art, and healing, as it can elevate the emotions of an audience or soothe a grieving heart. It is also used in more sinister ways, such as controlling a mob or inciting fear.
- **Challenges**: Tapping into raw emotions can be dangerous. Syncopates must be careful not to lose themselves in the feelings they manipulate, as the power can be overwhelming and addictive.

These varied forms of magic make up the core of mystical practices in this world. Each type has its own history, philosophy, and unique challenges, creating a diverse and complex magical landscape.

They removed the dwarves by just flaming the tunnels with their dragons, but now they don't really have the same dragon population they used to, and they can't ever quite get the last of the goblins, which is all it takes for them all to immediately repopulate the mountains.\n\n------------\n

# Malstaris

Tags: plane

Malstaric Rivers go through the land, which can sweep your [shadow](Life and Death) away.

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate [Malstaris](Malstaris). There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in [Malstaris](Malstaris), and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

[Malstaris](Malstaris) is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in [Malstaris](Malstaris) can cause strange interactions, as your [soul](Life and Death) is so far away, and your [shadow](Life and Death) so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made [Malstaris](Malstaris) their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids.

High above [Malstaris](Malstaris) is [Nydus, the Black Sun](Nydus, the Black Sun), spilling heavy darkness across the land.\n\n------------\n

# Material Plane

Tags: [planes](Planes)

The [Material Plane](Material Plane) is enormous, and consists of several different layers. On the top half is [Belagria](Belagria), consisting of the [Surfacelands](Surfacelands) and the [Underrealms](Underrealms). The surface lands are where most of "life" occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. The [Underrealms](Underrealms), on the other hand, are a 200 mile thick crust of stone crisscrossed with tunnels and caves, and filled with mysteries and [monsters](Monsters).

As you travel deeper into the [Underrealms](Underrealms), the downward pressure keeping your boots pressed to the ground grows weaker and weaker until you eventually reach [Emphathum](Emphathum)—a 100 mile stretch of weightlessness, filled with floating stones and absolute darkness.

If you down even further, your weight returns, but in the opposite direction from before. Now, you would be heading up, and would be in the second, lower half of the [Material Plane](Material Plane)—[Phlethageros](Phlethageros). [Phlethageros](Phlethageros) is dominated by a [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus), a massive maze, which eventually ends at the lower surface known as [the Wastes](The Wastes)—the Phlethagoran counterpart to the Surfacelands.

### [Emphathum](Emphathum)

A [region](Regions) with zero gravity, massive floating rocks similar to asteroids, and almost no life. Few have ever crossed this. It is the space between the Underrealms and [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus).

### [Phlethageros](Phlethageros)

The world on the underside of [Belagria](Belagria). Cruel, corrupted, and horrible, it is a brutal world.

#### [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus)

Millions of miles of labrythine passages stretching across the entire plane, for the entire 200 miles beneath [the Wastes](The Wastes) and [Emphathum](Emphathum).

#### [The Wastes](The Wastes)

The barren, lava covered, poison-gas filled, tornado ridden surface of Phethageros. Nothing gets past this—a barrier between the demons above, and the prisoners of [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) below.

#### [Stalactites of Geth](Stalactites of Geth)

Massive, low hanging stalactites constantly pour forth lava from above [the Wastes](The Wastes). Hundreds of thousands of demons live in these stalactites.

### The Edges of the World

**North/South/East/West**: if you walk far enough in any of the cardinal direction, eventually you will wrap around the side of the world and into [Celesté](Celesté).

**Up**: Although it is difficult, by traveling directly up far enough, you eventually reach the Astral Sea, and then the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) itself.

**Down**: Reaching [Malstaris](Malstaris) by foot is by all practical means—impossible. Instead, those who wish to journey there travel via [Deoric](Deoric) [magic](Magic).\n\n------------\n

# Maun

Tags: citystate

[Maun](Maun) is the home to the most famous [dwarven](Dwarves) school of music and theater in [Alaria](Alaria). Many bards travel to Maun to learn from the great scholars of the school.

Comes with a cost. Everyone who goes _must_ serve a year in the military or mines, either mining or fighting the beasts within the [mountain](Mountains). You can either do it simultaneously, or sequentially.

Yearly competition at the school for musical ability. Chapion gets an incredibly powerful magical instrument.

"The Ghost" wanders halls of school, offering help. Some believe he is one of the founders.

The island is guarded over, by [Damasaki Edara](Damasaki Edara), the daughter of [Nagatayora](Nagatayora), a massive female dragon who raises the eggs before setting them free. The dragon riders of [Adrus](Adrus) (now [Adron](Adron)) would travel to the [Maw of Chao](Maw of Chao) to be blessed by Damasaki Edara, and thereby be approved to raise and ride with [dragons](Dragons).\n\n------------\n

## History

Myorna: 50 years ago, [Myorna](Myorna) did not exist. But then, moon [elves](Elves) surfaced from the mountains, declaring that now they wanted to interact with the rest of the world, and trade. Since then, relations have been tenuous. Despite entering into the [Aldriktch trade alliance](Aldriktch Trade Alliance) with its neighbors, discoveries about the nature of moon [elves](Elves) (also known as silver [elves](Elves) here) has made their neighbors wary. More recent terrorist attacks with links pointing back to [Myorna](Myorna) have made their neighbors outright hostile. Even within Myorna there is political unrest. [King Thyolinor](King Thyolinor) brought the kingdom to the surface, but many feel they are unwelcome, and wish to return to the caves from which they came. [King Thyolinor](King Thyolinor) is not without supporters though—many of the settlements closer to the borders have already begun to assimilate into Erasnian (Erasnus) culture, and hope to stay.

Even longer ago, [Tiira](Tiira) was made into their goddess, after Myorna was driven underground by other [elves](Elves). [Elves](Elves) spent thousands of years underground.\n\n------------\n

Tags: [race](Races)

# Overview

Naga make up a long line of [humans](Humans) with dragon blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-father and first son of Gaia. When Shara Bolasi died to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically, Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and heated the lands beneath it, the people below transformed and became the Naga that still exist today.

Naga are passionate and determined in all that they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy. They also have a profound sense of pride, both for themselves, their culture, and the things they care about. If they feel that any of those things have been wronged, then they will not back down until amends have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to behold.

Feel an innate aversion to killing wolves, Ulvesjael, lions, and Sharabha.

# Nektuna

Tags: [state](States)

Nektuna is an incredibly powerful [state](States), controlling the Tarkhetan Strait—a very thin passage of water connecting the Shattered Sea to the Gray Sea. They tax all trade that passes through the port, which causes dissatisfaction among traders. However, Tarkhetan is a massive fortress equipped with powerful armaments and a large navy, ensuring the state’s dominance.

The city is built upon a leyline of fire, allowing powerful firemages to grow up in the city, capable of easily incinerating ships from afar. Despite its strength, Nektuna is hardly safe, surrounded by those interested in seizing its wealth and controlling the strait themselves.

Nektuna is a diverse place, primarily inhabited by [humans](Humans), but it also has a massive population of Craven and smaller populations of dwarblin, trollkin, and even ayblek. Additionally, a fair number of weblin travel throughout, selling their wares.

Nektuna also controls the island of Pyris, home to an old [race](Races) of [dwarves](Dwarves) who have interbred with humans long enough to create a unique mix of the two. The inhabitants are mostly farmers who seek simple lives away from the complexities of the mainland.

Besnoumeru, located directly on the leyline of time, is almost as famously wealthy as Tarkhetan, thanks to its merchants' phenomenal ability to predict changes in supply and demand before they happen. Nektuna is also in possession of Astrelle.

# Neth

Tags: [race](Races), [humans](Humans)

# Overview

Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It is easy to misinterpret a Neth’s silence at a joke as boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while never breaking a smile.

Neth are best known for their ability to speak with the wind, allowing them to communicate with the deceased members of their communities to gather advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For this reason, maintaining good relation with one’s family, and community are critical to Neth culture, an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they meet who become close.

Neth can be found across the [Amber Coast](Amber Coast), along the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers, and resilient warriors.

# Order Of Bryn

Tags: faction

The Order of Bryn is an potent religious group, with collosal numbers. Have sects around the world, praying to [Bryn](Bryn). Slow migration of where summer is hotter depending on the sects. During winters, they stop praying as much (still a ton), but allow people to leave the churches and travel and learn. It gives plants a natural cycle, etc, and means that followers can have a break.

The order is always looking for new members. Some people consider it an honor, others want nothing to do with it. Within the group, you have free food and shelter for life. You are free to (and encouraged) to sleep with others and propogate the church. When you join, you are given the Mark of Bryn—a sun, branded into your chest.

The church is always trying to get money from governments, trying to stay alive. Countries/locations can pay to have the church pray more for that area, meaning the sun lingers in the sky longer in that [region](Regions), though for the most part, the sun goes aroudn the center. The Order will also use winter as a tactic to raise money—if they need more money, they can just let the winter get worse by ordering followers not to pray.

Higher level priests stare into the sun and blind themselves, further devoting themselves to Bryn's magic.\n\n------------\n

# Oznak

Tags: [race](Races)

# Overview

Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and place a high emphasis on proving one’s self-worth and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a young age, children are taught with sticks how to wield a sword, even if they will never be able to afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in Oznak-dominated settlements also include different types of competitions involving sword play, and proper tournaments are common in some regions.

While excelling with the blade garners the most respect, those who don’t become the best are pressured to succeed and dominate in another field. This mentality results in a culture of highly competitive people. Because they value skill so highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into a duel with an Oznak.

Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria, though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in the world, and are known for their technical craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying swordsmen.

A city was built by the queen, and the [Dengar](Dengar) fled to it, running from a swamp that had turned against them.

An ancient order of lich hunters. They had questionable means of fighting liches (using Deoric themselves—see the [Whispering Isles](Whispering Isles)), but they were very successful.

# Plains of Wycendeula

Tags: [plains](Plains)

The plains are completely overrun with satyrs. Random camps are everywhere, dotted with buffalo hide tents. The plains are quite fertile, but the [satyr](Satyr) can't organize well enough to begin farming.

Despite having no government, rumors of a self-proclaimed king of the satyr have begun to spread. A satyr of dark and mysterious origins, with ambitions to unite all of the Satyr. These rumors terrify [Balduahr](Balduahr), the much smaller [dwarven](Dwarves) kingdom in the southwest, which would have no hopes of defending itself if all of the satyr accross Wycenduala united.\n\n------------\n

# Planar Stack

A [planar stack](Planar Stack) is a collection of tightly grouped [planes](Planes), usually holding strong connections to each other.

A [planar stack](Planar Stack) consists of a series of [planes](Planes), clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, [magic](Magic), and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a [planar stack](Planar Stack), to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.

## Major Planar Stacks

- [Alaria](Alaria)
- [Epyphiozath](Epyphiozath)
- [Instruxofinum](Instruxofinum)

## Glyssen

Glyssen is a spherical ocean of whispers and insanity. Aberrant creatures roam across both the currents and time itself. No one has returned with their sanity intact.

## Klokas

Klokas is a vast void of empty space filled with huge demonic creatures floating through the skies.

## Narglon

Completely dark, nothing can be seen in Narglon. Those who have returned have come back infected with the darkness itself. Like a horrible, infective liquid of nothingness.

## Minor Planar Stacks

- [Lanthornia](Lanthornia)\n\n------------\n

# Planes

Planes are scattered throughout the universe, in clumps called "[Planar Stacks](Planar Stack)". Planes can be physically connected, but usually have differen't physics. Planes can sometimes have an inverse side. In reality, this is just a different plane. However, when the other plane holds a strong connection with one other plane, sometimes they are refered to as two sides of the same plane—with one being the "positive" side, and the other being "negative". test\n\n------------\n

# Plathk

Tags: [monster](Monsters)

Ravenous, yellow-orange demons that occasionally show up from other planes. They devour everyone. Very hard to kill.\n\n------------\n

# Plenjorn Swamp

# Polar Unicorn

Tags: [monster](Monsters)

A giant, white shaggy beast with a single, large horn. Looks like an elephant-rhino.\n\n------------\n

# Postronamas Empire

Tags: ruins, [state](States)

Long ago fell to civil war, and eventually died out kool-aid style. Located in the [Piktiniti Desert](Piktiniti Desert)

Had beautiful insect armor, line art, insect partnerships, and knew the secret of harvesting twyl—getting the large dung beetles to vibrate their wings, which causes the right frequency of vibrations to break the bonds between the crystals and the sand they are attachced to.

Egypt + Japan + Tlingit\n\n------------\n

# Poum-Titch

Tags: [state](States)

Inhabited by [Scalawags](Scalawags). Huge civil war has recently broken out. Total disaster, as northern nation declares independence from rest of [state](States). Total chaos, lots of death. Armies are assembling and marching on each other.\n\n------------\n

# Promise of Mythras

Tags: poi

A massive stone object, permanently trapping the [Sennites](Sennites) within [Ennros Lake](Ennros Lake). Named after [Mythras](Mythras), the great [dwarven](Dwarves) family and king of Argysis before it fell to the dragon. When they got revenge, they placed a powerful enchantment on lake, barring the Sennites from ever leaving the lake. The Sennites would pay very handsomely for its removal.

On it is engraved, "A promise, once broken, can be no better reforged than a sword of diamond".

If a sword of diamond is brought to the site and broken, the enchantment is lifted.

[Diamonds](Diamonds) necessary to make an entire sword can only be found deep underground (verrrry deep) where it would be quite sketchy to go.\n\n------------\n

# Pseilemori

Tags: [monster](Monsters)

Pretty little winged creatures. They are exactly what you think they are, good or bad. For some, they can kill you with a touch—for others they are loving, playful creatures. They are most heavily influenced by whoever they are in closest proximity to. Some people live among them. Frequently kill children, or if not children, they do upon seeing adult (adult fears they're killers, then the [Pseilemori](Pseilemori) kills both of them).\n\n------------\n

# Psywinds

The flow of all thoughts, ideas, and emotions across Alaria. These thoughts pass through all. It is how telepathic creatures communicate. It allows syncopaths to function. It is also how prayers can be heard from Celesté. You can hear your [true name](True Name) no matter where it is spoken from on Alaria.

The psy winds are the "thought" subset of the flowing [ezz](Ezz).

Somewhat related to [Faesong](Faesong).\n\n------------\n

# Pyonokraus

Tags: city, [state](States)

Home to some [Ayblek](Ayblek).

This city is cursed—none of the inhabitants can ever leave, including those who enter from the outside. Built into a titan skull on the mountainside, it has layers upon layers of city built on top of itself, since there's nowhere to go but down and on top of existing buildings.

It has a similar feel to the mining town in guardians of the galaxy where they meet the bioengineer

It has existed for millenia, and contains secrets completely unknown to the outside world. Getting them, however, is quite difficult; no one who enters can ever leave. You can greet people at the border, but you have to be able to offer something fantastic to make them willing to share—after all, they're screwed, and they have no reason to help you if you can't offer something incredible in return.\n\n------------\n

# Pythalomos

Tags: [monster](Monsters), dragon

Dragon of constrictor snakes. False dragon—self declared god of contstrictor snakes. Hated by the [Naruaghin](Naruaghin), and given a wide birth.

Very long neck, body and tail. Upon constriction, you make contested strength check. If you fail, take a wound. On fail by factor of 2 or more, you take two wounds instead. Fail by factor of 3, three wounds. Tail and neck can each attack. When captured, it's 5 levels of restrained.

Much taller than typical [elves](Elves), in order to see over the tall grasses of the plains. Bronze skin, sharp teeth. Flat, somewhat square faces. Sign language for everything.\n\n------------\n

Tags: [monster](Monsters)

A disgusting cross between goblins and rats, these creatures multiply tremendously fast, aren't super bright, and plague cities. They are difficult to get rid of, can wriggle in and out of anywhere.

No one bats an eye if you kill one. They are sentient, but don't posess empathy of their own. Feed on carrion, anything. Will steal babies if left unattended.\n\n------------\n

# Real Forest

Tags: [forest](Forests)

During fall, the pollen from the trees causes dreams and reality to intermingle. Unclear if you're awake or asleep. Extremely disorienting.

# Revenants

Tags: [race](Races)

## Overview

[Revenants](Revenants) are those who were once alive, but whose spirits were so strong that their astral and malstaric thread remained bound, and although their bodies became inanimate, they lived on in the material world. This is generally due to having some feeling of unfinished work to do in the world, whether it be defending some person or location, completing a mission, or being with one’s true love.

Although their bodies are gone, their [spirit](Life and Death) remains intact, and they can ihabit new bodies to control them instead.

Once you were dead, but now—well, you still are, kind of. [Revenants](Revenants) are semi corporeal versions of their past, living, selves. When a creature dies and rather than leaving its physical form, chooses to remain within, it forfeits its ability to ever leave and is eternally trapped in the material world where they remain as a [revenant](Revenants). There are many reasons [revenants](Revenants) may choose to stay, but the most common involve unfinished business. Whether it’s getting revenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this goal is a top priority. While revenants may take detours along the way, they will always come back to their purpose for remaining in the material world.

<br>
By remaining in the material world, revenants forfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a [revenant](Revenants) has completed whatever business kept them in this world, they generally slowly go crazy and are eventually hunted down and killed by [children of Anubis](Children of Anubis) or other specialized killers. 
Due to revenant’s near immortality, they are forced to watch as everyone they love inevitably grows old and dies, which contributes to the slow decaying of their sanity.

### Vitals

Type: [race](Races)  
Depends on the [race](Races) of whichever body you inhabit

### Traits

#### [Undead](Undead)

_Passive ability._

You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and cannot be poisoned.

You have already died, and can therefore not die again in the traditional sense. However, should your maximum hitpoints fall to 0 and you “die”, you fall unconscious for 24 hours and are reborn where you died the first time with no memory of your life after death.

You take double damage from silvered weapons, and if you should die to a silver weapon, you are dead forever.

Also, your physical body is no longer fully alive, and it will slowly decay with passing time. Though you can generally maintain your appearance from your moment of death, your skin will no longer close up over wounds, so your body will begin to fall apart. For this reason, many revenants prefer to cover up as much of their skin as possible, and to travel unnoticed. Once you have died in a corpse three times, it is too mangled to ever return to.

#### Detached [Spirit](Life and Death)

_Passive ability._

You have a [soul](Life and Death), [shadow](Life and Death), and [spirit](Life and Death)—all necessary for true life, but they are no longer bound to your corporal body in the same way—instead, it is through willpower alone that you keep them attached to your physical form. This is a constant struggle, and when you waver, your form flickers as your [spirit](Life and Death) sloughs away from your skin. This, however, comes with benefits.

As an action, you may let your concentration fall, causing you to dissolve into a pool of light and [shadow](Life and Death). While in this form, you gain the following effects:

- You can fit through any space larger than the width of a pebble.
- You cannot interact with the physical world
- You take half damage from all non-silver, non-iron sources, rounded down.
- You can only take the help or dash action.
- You cannot speak.
- Your physical body remains collapsed wherever you left it. You may return to it, or any other unoccupied corpse.

# Sharabha

Tags: [race](Races), [human](Humans)

# Overview

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father and third child of Gaia. When Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped Shara Bolasi’s heart out through his chest, before stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when people had settled across Alaria once more, the [humans](Humans) who ate from the soil there became the first Sharabha.

Sharabha are known for their warmth, compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most respected member of a pride. They will make unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is chosen.

Outside these communities, Sharabha who have willingly left do not practice many of their more traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of principles and morality.

Feel an innate aversion to killing Wolves, Ulvsjael, Lions, and Sharabha.

Although the infamous Glathkus the Cruel (a.k.a. The Rat King) is believed to have eaten his own young (in order to gain the strength they had been granted by being dipped in the Nyxthos River), most skaag families are fairly “normal”, except for a perhaps more rowdy and fend-for-yourself upbringing.

Although there is only one true skaag city, skaag can be found dispersed across Alaria. Many of them find their home in the underbellies of cities across the continents, usually literally underground.

# Starfall

Tags: poi

Starfall is a pool of intense, other-worldly energy. Just as the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) provide energy to life in Alaria, Starfall is a pool made of the energy used on a distant planar stack.

By mashing up bark, roots, some berries, and other ingredients from the wilderness, you can create pastes and potions with variable effects. Brewed items go bad after one day, at which point they have no effect. Brewing a potion requires a fire and 10 uninterrupted minutes of preparation.

<hr>

#### Worldly Traveler

_Occasional ability. Slow. With GM approval._

You have traveled the world and met many, many people. When you meet someone who the GM describes as someone you’ve never met, you may choose to claim some connection to them. If you do, the GM will explain how you recognize them, and the nature of your connection. This connection may be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is possible there is no feasible connection between you and this person. In this case, you may either regain the use of this ability, or take three destiny points. You cannot use this ability to claim connections with people more influential than yourself.

<div class="destiny-level">Destiny Level</div class="destiny-level">

Rather than claim a connection to someone you meet, you may use this ability before actually running into someone. For example, while at a bar in a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM also believes this to be plausible, your connection becomes real (though their location and condition may have changed since the last time you talked with them). If the GM doesn’t believe this to be reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.

These [dwarves](Dwarves) have been sold into slavery by their very own people. Those that flee north are denied into the northern towns due to a treaty between [Gorath](Gorath) and [Tamadrez](Tamadrez) that forbids the Northerners from accepting slaves from the south, in exchange for not being invaded by [Gorath](Gorath).

Many in the north turn a blind eye to the slaves, but the threat of [Gorath](Gorath) invasion is very real and terrifying, so open dismissal of the treaty could spell disaster for [Tamadrez](Tamadrez). Once, several years ago, a northern town was found to be harboring hundreds of escaped slaves. A Gorathi warship came by and firebombed the entire city to ash, killing thousands.

[Gorath](Gorath) has not invaded for the primary reason that its forces are already spread quite thin, due to brutal wars along its northwest and eastern borders. Gorath can only profit off of Tamadrez so long as it remains divided.

# The Dragon Forest

Tags: [forest](Forests)

Also known as Bysal Emmus

The dragon [forest](Forests) is a small dark wood that became the domain of a famous dark [elf](Elves) beast tamer with an affinity for taming dragons. The tamer filled the [forest](Forests) with all manner of dark dragon as well as other beasts until it was as well fortified as any of the surrounding cities. The forest became a sanctuary for animals and wild things with the dark [elf](Elves) as the keeper of order. After the dark elf passed the older dragons took on the responsibility and continue to maintain order within the forest so that the creatures can live in close proximity peacfully and ward off unwanted civilizations as a united front.

Now watched over by [Ziru](Ziru). \n\n------------\n

# The Fallen

The Fallen is an order comprised of a single champion. The order was established in ancient times by a mercenary [hero](Heroes) who collected magic items and stowed them away in a hidden tower known as the [Tower of Gwyndar](Tower Of Gwyndar). Towards the end of the champion's life, they acquired a dark orb that would seek out a new Fallen upon the previous fallen's death. Thy new fallen would be given dreams and nightmares of their destiny by the orb. These visions led them to the hidden tower were they were gifted the entirety of the order's acrewed wealth and power. In exchange they were expected to further the order's name and influence. Often the Fallen can be seen riding an immortal nightmare which became fond of the champions over the years and allowed itself to be tamed by them. \n\n------------\n

# The Four Dragon Blades

Each of the four dragon blades is an ancient item that was forged by a dark [elf](Elves) master smith. The blades are a rare example of [elven](Elves) smithing competing with the best of the drwaven and cyclopse craftsmen. Although none of the blades are enchanted, they were made with such skill and such rare material that they posses mythic properties, allowing them to aid the weilder in supernatural ways without the use of conventional magic or mana. The blades where forged for dragon riders of the ancient dark elf empire. The hilt of the blade is modelled after the dragon's maw while the blade its[elf](Elves) is modelled after the dragon's tongue. This design resulted in the swords looking thick, wavey, and slightly sluggish. Their shape combined with their dark materials have led to them being described as crude or unsightly but on the battle field they serve their purpose flawlessly. They swing with speed and ease despite their size and shape and they seperate flesh, bone, and armor alike, without becoming dull. The blades have been scattered and traded over the years but remain legendary items coveted by dark elf establishments.\n\n------------\n

# The Golden Enchanting Table

The Golden Enchanting Table was built by one of the greatest golden beard [dwarf](Dwarves) forges of all time. Although he is also famous for erecting the legendary 9-ringed city, the enchanting table is the crown jewel of his achievements. The table is made of the purest gold and resides at the center of a room made of ever turning gears. The gears are enchanted with lesser souls, allowing them to continue turning without fuel. On each side of each tooth of each gear, there is a fundamental rune that inevitably connects with the runes of each other gear during its rotation. When the fundamental runes of different gears touch they form a classical rune that draws power from the tables core (a legendary soul) and presents itself to whomever stands within the room of the enchanting table. Once the rune is presented to the tables user, they may use it however they wish without the need of [soul](Life and Death) energy or a sacrifice. The gears in the room are set up in a way that each gear migrates around the room over the course of a decade so that it can make contact with every other room and form as many different classical runes as possible. Reknowned enchanters search for the table and fight for a place at it so that they may learn from its complicated design and use is renewable magic. The golden beard dwarf who designed the table was a genious and an outlier within history. He was able to construct the fundamental runes from an advanced understanding of magic, souls, and enchanting that few beings have been able to replicate since.\n\n------------\n

## History

\n\n------------\n

# The Iron Orc

The Iron [Orc](Orcs) is a legendary figure, particularly among the black orc tribes who take pride in their naturally tough skin. The Iron Orc trained and tortured his skin with all manner of devices and persued the path of a mercenary in order to encounter frequent peril so that his skin my adapt and become even tougher. During his travels, the orc collected magical weapons and items. Namely, an enchanted golden sword sword with a yellow gem at the center of the hilt and a black scyth enscribed with red runes. The sword allowed the orc to manipulate sand and the scyth could syphon life force from its victims. Although the orc's skin became even more of a rarity than his weapons, the orc continued to enter battle with one of the weapons in each hand, forgoing a shield and armor. This aggressive and lobsided style of fighting became symbolic of the Iron Orc and so the weapons became very recognizable. In his later life, the orc tamed a massive boar who matched his thirst for combat and glory. Although the orc possessed no taming abilities, he bested the board in combat over and over again until the boar accepted his commands, as is common practice among [orcish](Orcs) boar riders. As the orc's skin began to surpass the resiliance of fine armors, the Iron Orc began to set out on more intentional quests in order to test his limits. The last of these tests was to stand in dragon fire, which he did. At this point the orc's skin was believed to have long ascended from the realm of physical into the realm of mystical although his skin was never enchnated nor did it possess any external magics. \n\n------------\n

\n\n------------\n

# The River Elf Blade Master

The river [elves](Elves), although small in population, are a people dedicated to honing the practice of blade dancing. This practice is more of an art form than an actual fighting technique but its has the potential to be elevated for such use. A few river elves persue the title of blade master which signifies their ability to use blade dancing for practical purposes. The art focuses on maintaining a special type of composure and form which allows the blade master to cut through material regardless of the sharpness of the blade making is comprable to water the way that if flows and the weight behind its sharpness. The art also allows particularly skilled blade masters to move quicker than normal reaching an almost mythical level where they were believed to be able to "flow" through their enemies attacks when, in reality, they were evading them. The pinacle of the art was the skill to move so symetrically and quickly that enemies believed the blade master was fighting alongside a doble ganger of themselves who was also weilding an identical blade. The river [elf](Elves) blade master became a legendary pupil of the art and reached the point where they could momic themselves eight times over. Their skill became so honed that the technical application of what they learned became entirely depended on mythical techniques that far exceeded normal physical limits. These mythical techniques became realized by the river elf blade master through a lifetime of unbroken study and training. The master is often compared to other great sages and monks as their superior or role model. \n\n------------\n

# Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

Sun passes around center strip every day, all year. No Tilt.

Three moons pass over at various times throughout month.

Seasons come and go when followers convince [Bryn](Bryn) to traverse a different trail across Alaria.

Stars are viewports for the gods. They can look down upon their subjects. Usually located above some place of importance to them.

Moon cycles: Two main moons, one has 11 day cycles, is used to tell what day of the week it is. Full moon once a week, on the start of the week. The other goes through a 23 day cycle, meaning about once every year there is one double full moon, and one moonless night, each important holidays. The year is 200 days long, split into eight, 25 day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice (no summer v winter with two hemispheres). 2 quarters spring, 2 quarters summer, 2 quarters fall, 2 quarters winter. When solstice (new year) coincides with a double full moon, or a double empty, it signals the beginning of a new age, occurring once every 25,300 years (~18,000 Earth Years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years.

Moon phase is determined by location of [Aurus](Aurus, the White Sun) and [Nydus](Nydus, the Black Sun), the light and dark suns respectively. Moons tied to magic of Malstaric and Astral planes.

Third, rogue moon, known as the Killing Moon. Looking upon it kills you. Comes up once every 8,000 years or so, but isn't consistent. Remains up for same duration, so can mean ~8,000 years of death.

Years counted forward from 0 to 25,300, and then back down again. The suffix F or B stands for if time is going forward or backward. At 0 there is a double new moon during the northern-summer solstice/southern-winter solstice. At 25,300, there is a double full moon on new-year. Each marks the beginning of a new age.

Moons aligning represents cycle of [magic](Magic), whereas new year is cycle of nature. Moon [elf](Elves), and other cultures who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on dual full moon, etc.

Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to [magic](Magic) and more so to nature. Celebrations on first day of spring, new-year/solstice, last week of fall, and other solstice. Both are celebrated, though winter ones are more about trying to be cheerful in the face of winter.

Moon and [Magic](Magic) divinely intertwined.

### 11 days of the week, starting at new moon, going to full, then waning again:

1. Cautious (new moon): Don't go out at night
2. Wakeday (waxing crescent): Made it to next week, can come out now
3. Patrons' Day: Thank your [daemon](Daemons)
4. Moil
5. Marketday: Trading happens
6. Merrynight: Full moon, time to stay up late
7. Brightlove: More full moon, time for joy
8. Lazyday
9. Farewell: People leave to return home
10. Gather: Prepare (for fireday and cautious, but also just in general)
11. Fireday (waning crescent): Burn candles during hte night

# Trollkin

Tags: [race](Races)

## Overview

Half-breeds and outcasts—trollkin are the unwanted children of [humans](Humans) and trolls. Rare is the troll and [human](Humans) couple, and rarer still is the trollkin child that makes it past the first few months in the world. If not surreptitiously smothered or abandoned in a [forest](Forests), most trollkin end up in orphanages, where they grow up as outsiders amongst their peers. In troll communities, they are viewed as weak and fragile, and in [human](Humans) communities, they are viewed as too stupid and emotionless to be effective members of society.

<br>
Unfortunately for trollkin, they are perfectly capable of understanding and figuring out many things, but are terrible at expressing it. Some trollkin abandon society to live alone in nature, becoming hermits and befriending the animals around them, who they may feel more comfortable around.

<br>
Others choose to become experts in a niche field of academics, where they do not need to interact with many people, but can still let their creative, roaming minds explore. Many of the greatest discoveries were made by trollkin, though credit may never be given to their name. 
Still others turn to more violent areas of life. When faced with the constant frustration of trying to get others to understand you, some eventually consider violence. Due to their troll blood and hide, trollkin are formidable agents in combat.

# Ulvsjael

Tags: [race](Races)

# Overview

The ulvsjael are [human](Humans) descendants of Ulvma, the wolf mother and the second child of the Gaia. When Shara Bolasi died in his duel against Hykravones, Nagatayora had descended into madness, Ulvma stayed back with the armies of Alaria and fought till the very end before being cut down and collapsing into the ground amongst the armies. When [humans](Humans) came and drank from her blood, the Ulvsjael were born.
The Ulvsjael are a pragmatic and fiercely loyal [race](Races) who believe in the natural order of life. Much of life revolves around small, nomadic units which travel as a pack. They will protect their comrades with their own lives, but they also feel no qualms about keeping those who cannot defend themselves alive. If you cannot contribute, you are culled. This harsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders, who are usually seen as dead weight until they have proven their worthiness to their pack. However, when the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider—a rare appearance, due to their tendency to stick with their kind—they are frequently the hardest working, such is their desire to prove their usefulness to a new community.
Ulvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are known for their formidable mercenary groups, trackers, and explorers.

Feel an innate aversion to killing Dragons, Naga, Lions, and Sharabha.

or you could just go to the [homepage](homepage) of the wiki, this will do all these automatic.

## How to go to previous file?

cd inside 'wikmd/wiki'

Find the version you would like to revert to.

```
git log -p file.md

# World Timeline

# Timeline of Alaria

## The Primordial Era: The Birth of Everything

In the unfathomable vastness of pre-existence, two formless entities emerged: Melera and Azus. Often referred to as "she" and "he" respectively, these primordial beings embodied infinite power but lacked purpose. Their interactions gave birth to the universe itself, a grand attempt at communication and self-expression.

### The Cyclone of Possibilities (4 - 1.3 billion years ago)

In the swirling cosmic soup of early existence, Azus and Melera manifested as the first gods, each with distinct philosophies that would shape the fabric of reality:

- **Azus**: The embodiment of order and balance, Azus envisioned a universe governed by strict rules. His ideology dictated that for every act of creation, there must be an equal act of destruction. Azus valued logic, linearity, and the preservation of cosmic equilibrium.

- **Melera**: In stark contrast, Melera perceived the universe as a grand instrument capable of producing beauty from chaos. Her approach emphasized dynamic expression and fluidity, rejecting the constraints of rigid order. Melera's nature remains shrouded in mystery, her narrative largely lost to time.

Together, these primordial entities fashioned Ezz, an energy that embodies both their beliefs. However, Azus soon recognized that his ideals of law and order were irretrievably compromised by the unpredictability inherent within Ezz. In response, he created Planar Stacks, protective bubbles shielding realities from the chaos of Ezz.

Most planar stacks remained void of Melera's influence, with Alaria standing as a notable exception due to a rift causing massive amounts of Ezz to spill through from the beyond.

### The Contraction (1.3 billion - 235 million years ago)

For over a billion years, Azus meticulously manipulated the cosmos, building planar stacks throughout existence. This period, known as the Contraction, saw Azus tightening and sorting the universe, bringing everything closer together and into neater arrangements. The universe as we know it began to take shape during this time, with the fundamental laws of physics and magic slowly solidifying.

## The Age of Titans (235 - 100 million years ago)

### The Birth of Alaria (235 million years ago)

Alaria, one of the last planar stacks to form, came into existence without any psyic energy. Initially, it consisted of only three primary planes: the Material Realm, the Astral Plane, and Malstaris. This unique configuration would later play a crucial role in shaping the world's magical landscape.

### The Lyzaria Era (235 - 180 million years ago)

The first titans to emerge were the god-titans: [Nydus](Nydus, the Black Sun), [Aurus](Aurus, the White Sun), and Celesté. These siblings possessed power far beyond that of any other beings. From their union came Lyzaria, the first true titan and the namesake of this era.

Titans were colossal, powerful beings responsible for creating most life on Alaria. They likely used Deoric magic in their creations, though the exact methods remain a mystery. Titans populated all three planes, building their most epic civilizations in the depths of the Astral Sea and deep within the caves of Malstaris.

#### The Sacrifice of Celesté

Celesté, the youngest of the god-titan siblings, was assigned dominion over the Material Plane. Unlike her brothers, she had been touched by Melera's song, granting her a unique perspective on creation. Witnessing the frequent battles between Nydus and Aurus, which often resulted in the destruction of other titans' work, Celesté made a fateful decision.

In an act of supreme sacrifice, Celesté transformed herself into a celestial body that would become her namesake. This new astral formation became a source of power for the titans of the Material Plane, forever changing the magical landscape of Alaria.

### The Ezz Rift (120 million years ago)

The reign of titans came to a catastrophic end with the Ezz Rift—a world-altering event that began when a leak in the Alarian Planar Stack caused Ezz to flood the world. As Alaria filled with Ezz, Melera's music permeated every corner of existence.

The titans, beings of pure logic and order, had never experienced emotions before. The sudden onslaught of feelings drove them to madness. Countless titans, naturally ageless, chose to end their own lives to escape the unfamiliar and hated sensations. Those who could fled the plane, abandoning their magnificent cities and flying into the cosmos. Their fate, whether they still live or not, remains one of the greatest mysteries of Alaria.

This cataclysmic event marked the end of the second eon. The corpses of the titans who perished on Alaria became great sources of magical power. Even today, these titan remains are incredibly scarce and a source of enormous conflict wherever they are found.

## The Gaeaic Eon (120 million - 7,210 years ago)

In the aftermath of the Ezz Rift, Alaria underwent profound changes. The influx of Ezz caused the spiritual planes to separate from the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) planes, creating the additional planes: the Ethereal and the Nethereal planes. While many creatures perished alongside the titans, others survived, adapting to the new mixed atmosphere.

This new planar configuration gave rise to the psywinds and faesong. With Azus and Melera's influence combined, there was a constant whirlwind of exchanging energies among thought and emotion. These were the psywinds and faesong—a roiling sea of thought that permeates all of Alaria, and an ever present melody of every emotion on the planes. These new interactions gave rise to numerous new creatures on Alaria.

### The Birth of Gaea (120 million years ago)

From the ashes of the old world rose Gaea, the Earth Mother. Gaea was the emotion of the land itself, channeling her magic directly from the faesong that now pervaded the world.

Gaea's domain was everywhere, but her power was strongest in the material realm. She bore three sons who would become her protectors:

1. Nagatayora, the First Dragon
2. Ulvma, the First Wolf
3. Shara Bolasi, the First Lion

Gaea's creative power knew no bounds. She populated Alaria with all manner of life: from the majestic mammoths roaming the northern plains to the fierce dinosaurs stalking the eastern jungles, from the resilient scorpions of the deserts to the giant rocs soaring across the skies. However, intelligent life remained absent, with the exception of the enigmatic druids.

### The Druids (120 million years ago)

Alongside Gaea came the druids—an ancient [race](Races) of beings so attuned to nature that they were believed to be incarnations of the wilderness and life itself. Unlike nearly every other creature born in this period, the druids did not belong to Gaea. Instead, they worked alongside her, their interests often aligning but not always in perfect harmony.

The druids established small villages wherever life flourished on Alaria. They took on the role of caretakers, wielding powerful magic to control and nurture the land. The exact nature of their magic, like Gaeas, was a powerful combination of Azyen and Gaeic song

### The Reign of Dragons (100 - 2.5 million years ago)

Of Gaea's three children, Nagatayora was the eldest and proudest. The species he spawned—the dragons—would prove to become the most powerful creatures since the Age of Titans. During this time, dragons covered all six planes of Alaria, firmly establishing themselves at the top of both the social and natural hierarchies.

Ulvma and Shara also became the progenitors of their respective species, populating the forests and plains of Alaria. As sibling species, the three groups—dragons, wolves, and lions—formed a pact to never prey upon each other. This ancient agreement remains honored to this day, even among their descendants: the Naga, Sharabha, and Ulvsjael.

#### The Walk of [Elves](Elves) (10 million years ago)

Although the druids were immortal, they slowly dwindled in number over time, victims of accidents and conflicts, and unable to reproduce themselves. However, their legacy lived on through their creation: the elves. The druids crafted the elves from the branches of trees, the stones and mud from Alaria's rivers, and a spark of their own life essence.

The elves were made in the druids' image, sharing their pointed ears, slender forms, and graceful movements. They also inherited the druids' deep appreciation for nature and beauty. Gifted in all their endeavors, the [elven](Elves) population quickly grew and spread across Alaria. For many years, they worked in harmony with the dragons, and together, these two [races](Races) ruled the land.

#### Eyachria the Dragon Goddess (2 million years ago)

Among the dragons, one stood out above all others: Eyachria. She was Nagatayora's favorite, embodying the noblest qualities of dragonkind—honor, trustworthiness, and wisdom. Eyachria held the respect of all Alaria. However, as her eminence grew, so did her secret jealousy of Gaea's position as caretaker of the world.

Eyachria devised a plan to replace Gaea, believing that with time, she could surpass the Earth Mother. For thousands upon thousands of years, Eyachria grew in size and power. After many millennia, her wingspan nearly stretched across the planes. Entire cities flourished upon her back, and she became a continent unto herself.

It was at the height of her power that Eyachria challenged Gaea for the role of Alaria's caretaker. Eyachria could move mountains, breathe fire that could melt entire landscapes, and cast magic powerful enough to reshape reality. Gaea, in comparison, seemed but a whisper in the ground. Eyachria's assessment proved correct—Gaea was no match for her overwhelming might.

However, Nagatayora witnessed this confrontation. Just as he had given life to all other dragons, he possessed the power to take it away. With crushing despair, Nagatayora ended Eyachria's life. The great dragon goddess crashed to the ground, her life extinguished in an instant. To this day, her colossal spine remains visible as the [mountain](Mountains) range in the south of Aboyuinzu, a testament to her immense size and a reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition.

### The Birth of Man (2.5 million - 45,000 years ago)

Gaea, impressed by the success and intelligence of the elves and the druids but also somewhat jealous, set about working on her own creation. Although not as meticulously constructed as the elves, the determination that fueled Gaea's craft flowed into her new creations. From her work spawned the beastmen and [humans](Humans).

#### The Golden Age of Man (200,000 - 75,000 years ago)

Of all the races born from Gaea, humans proved to be the most versatile and ambitious. It was not long before they had spread to every corner of Alaria, ushering in the Golden Age of Man—a remarkable period lasting 125,000 years of flourishing civilization.

During this time, technology reached incredible levels that have never been matched since. Flying machines soared across the skies and even beyond the planes. Civilizations stretched from the deepest seas to the highest clouds. Magical knowledge became common and plentiful, with humans mastering various forms of magic, including Old Magic, [Spirit](Life and Death) Magic, and the emerging Avatar Magic.

This era also saw the rise of the daemons of Celesté. As Gaea's children explored the world, they began to understand the nature of the bond between Celesté, the material realm, and the psyic energy enveloping them both. People began moving across the planar boundary in droves, dramatically shifting the population away from the material realm to Celesté.

#### The God War (75,000 years ago)

As more and more people shifted to Celesté, the number of believers and prayers in the material realm began to dwindle rapidly. This led to a terrifying phenomenon: people across Celesté started to disappear. With the risks of returning to the material realm being too great, many remained in Celesté and fought viciously amongst themselves for followers on the material realm.

The combination of a desperate competition for survival among the daemons and a gross expenditure of power on their followers resulted in total war. Most people died, many others returned from Celesté and hid in isolation, while others continued to fight. The world war raged on for years until a follower of Dyos, in a last desperate act, used all of the power of his god to force an eruption of the Kajiit volcano. This cataclysmic event immediately killed millions more and triggered a volcanic winter that would plunge the world into a multi-millennia ice age.

#### The Long Winter (75,000 - 45,000 years ago)

As life withered and the ice age set in, the small pockets of surviving civilization went into hiding in the mountains. They eked out a meager existence, surviving on lichens and hunting the hardy animals that roamed the frozen surface. No daemons survived this period, as residents of the material realm lost all faith in their gods.

The Long Winter also took a heavy toll on the dragon population. Hundreds perished, unable to adapt to the harsh conditions. Many of those who survived became terrifying predators, terrorizing the skies and hunting anything that could be found. Technology regressed to a primitive [state](States) once more, with much of the knowledge from the Golden Age lost to time.

### The Age of Craggus (45,000 - 30,000 years ago)

The Age of Craggus began when a young man named Craggus, along with a group of devoted followers, successfully completed a perilous journey to Celesté. Their tribe, which remained alive in the material realm, began spreading the word of Craggus, who grew in power and slowly began to lift civilization out of despair. Craggus became the first new [Daemon](Daemons), earning the title of god of all men.

#### The Rise of the King (45,000 years ago)

Over the next thousand years, Craggus' name became more and more renowned. Through magnificent effort and the power granted to him by his followers, he managed to push back the ice age, ending millions of years of desolation. Craggus was hailed as a [hero](Heroes) and became the sole god of the material realm.

#### Craggus' Reign (45,000 - 30,000 years ago)

The next fifteen thousand years were marked by Craggus' kingship among the daemons of Celesté. Although society returned to a state of frequent war and conflict, and others joined Craggus in Celesté, he remained the king of all, and Alaria remained relatively stable under his rule.

During this period, technology once again advanced, climbing back to an industrial level as people relearned how to harness the power of aetherium. This was also a fortunate time during which the ominous killing moon remained dormant for the entire duration of Craggus' reign.

### The Lost Ages (30,000 - 10,209 years ago)

Less is known about the Lost Ages, as this period was marked by years of hardship and despair. Craggus' reign came to an abrupt end with the onset of a catastrophic event known as the laughing plague.

#### The Laughing Plague (30,000 - 28,800 BSD)

The laughing plague was a brutal disease that originated from the plane of Glyssen. How it managed to cross over to Alaria remains a mystery, but its effects were devastating. The plague slowly drove all those exposed to it into a fevering, maniacal madness that incited them to commit horrible acts of violence, all while uncontrollably laughing.

The disease spread through prolonged exposure to the sound of the laughter, bringing nearly all of Alaria to bloodthirsty insanity. A desperate fight for the survival of life on Alaria began, with creatures forced to turn on their own kin who had been infected. For 1,200 years, the Alarian population dwindled as people went into isolation, and trade and progress ground to a halt.

When the plague finally ran its course, it left the civilizations of Alaria in shambles. Entire cities lay barren—their citizens all dead, fallen by each other's hands. Only those deep underground or in complete isolation survived unaffected. Most written history was lost during this time, and technology once again regressed to a primitive [state](States).

##### The Birth of [Dwarves](Dwarves)

A few among the population held a natural resistance to the corrupting plague. Although they were immune to its violence-inciting effects, the disease stunted their growth and fundamentally and permanently changed those who survived it. These individuals became known as dwarves.

##### [Dwarves](Dwarves)

A few among the population held a natural resistance to this corrupting plague. Although they were immune to it's violence inciting effects, the disease stunted growth and fundamentally and permanently changed those who survived it. These men were known as dwarves. Entire communities of those immune formed—many of which were underground.

[Continuation of the previous content...]

Entire communities of those immune to the laughing plague formed, many of which were underground. These [dwarven](Dwarves) societies became known for their resilience and ingenuity, adapting to their subterranean homes with remarkable skill.

It is rumored that the laughing plague still circulates deep underground in Alaria, among a grotesque race known as the Kackles. The Uline [dwarves](Dwarves), a particularly hardy clan, are said to be holding the plague at bay, preventing it from resurging and threatening the surface world once more.

#### Rise of the False God (28,700 - 28,000 BSD)

In the wake of the laughing plague, a period of intense spiritual yearning gripped Alaria. From this desperation arose a being known only as the False God. This entity, neither daemon nor titan, claimed divinity and promised salvation to a world still reeling from the horrors of the plague.

The False God's reign lasted for seven centuries, during which it amassed a following that spread across much of Alaria. Its teachings were a mix of half-truths and outright fabrications, designed to keep its followers dependent and subservient. The False God's power grew with each new convert, feeding off their faith and devotion.

It was only through the combined efforts of a group of heroes, whose names have been lost to time, that the False God's true nature was revealed. In a climactic battle that reshaped the landscape, the False God was defeated, its essence scattered to the winds. The aftermath left a power vacuum that would take centuries to fill, as people struggled to rebuild their faith and society in the wake of this betrayal.

#### Blight of Arcanus (12,000 BSD)

The Blight of Arcanus marked one of the darkest periods in Alaria's magical history. A powerful curse swept across the land, turning the very practice of magic into a deadly endeavor. Those who attempted to use magic found themselves struck down, their life force drained away in an instant.

This catastrophic event brought down entire empires that had relied heavily on magical infrastructure and defenses. The curse's origin remains a mystery, with theories ranging from a backfired ritual of immense proportions to the dying curse of an ancient, wronged being.

The Blight of Arcanus forced a radical shift in how societies functioned, as they scrambled to adapt to a world without magic. This period saw a resurgence of purely physical technologies and a renewed appreciation for non-magical skills and crafts.

#### The Dark Night (12,000 - 11,500 BSD)

Following closely on the heels of the Blight of Arcanus came an even more terrifying phenomenon: The Dark Night. For 500 years, Alaria was plunged into an unnatural, all-encompassing darkness caused by a massive shadowrift—a tear in the fabric of reality that allowed the essence of the shadow plane to seep into the material world.

This period was marked by great fear and loss. The lack of sunlight caused widespread crop failures, leading to famine on a scale never before seen. Nocturnal creatures and beings from the shadow plane roamed freely, preying on the weakened populations of Alaria.

During this time, new forms of navigation and agriculture had to be developed. Bioluminescent plants and fungi became crucial resources, and entire civilizations adapted to life in perpetual darkness. The few magic users who survived the Blight of Arcanus became invaluable, using what little power they could safely wield to create sources of light and warmth.

#### The Oblivion Years (11,500 - 10,400 BSD)

As the shadowrift finally closed and light returned to Alaria, the world faced a new crisis: a near-complete loss of historical information. Whether due to the chaos of the Dark Night, a yet-unknown magical catastrophe, or some other cosmic event, almost all records of the past were erased or rendered indecipherable.

This period became known as the Oblivion Years, as civilizations essentially had to start over from scratch. Languages had to be reinvented, technologies rediscovered, and societies rebuilt from the ground up. It was a time of great innovation born out of necessity, but also one of great confusion and conflict as different groups struggled to assert their own versions of history and culture.

#### The Hel Dynasties (11,400 - 10,900 BSD)

From the chaos of the Oblivion Years rose a series of tyrannical regimes known collectively as the Hel Dynasties. These oppressive rulers, each claiming divine right and cosmic mandate, established themselves as complete overlords of the known world.

The Hel Dynasties were characterized by their brutal efficiency and technological advancements, often at the cost of individual freedoms and cultural diversity. They built vast cities and monuments, many of which still stand today as testament to their power and ambition.

Each dynasty claimed to be the true inheritors of some lost, glorious past, using fabricated histories to legitimize their rule. The period was marked by intense surveillance, forced labor, and the suppression of any form of dissent or alternative belief systems.

The era of the Hel Dynasties came to a cataclysmic end with the arrival of the Killing Moon, a celestial event that would reshape the political and magical landscape of Alaria once more.

#### The Blood War (10,900 BSD)

The Killing Moon's appearance triggered a massive conflict known as the Blood War. This wasn't merely a battle between dynasties, but a chaotic free-for-all as various factions, emerging warlords, and even common people rose up against their oppressors.

The war earned its grisly name from the unprecedented bloodshed that occurred. Forbidden magics were unleashed, ancient weapons were unearthed, and alliances were made and broken in the blink of an eye. The conflict raged across Alaria, leaving no corner of the world untouched by its violence.

In the end, there were no true winners. The Hel Dynasties were shattered, but so too were many of the rebel factions. The world was left in a [state](States) of anarchy, with small, isolated communities becoming the norm as people retreated from the devastation of large-scale conflict.

#### Evorkia's Vision (10,400 BSD)

Amidst the chaos following the Blood War, a powerful and benevolent lich named Evorkia experienced a catastrophic vision. In her mystical sight, she foresaw the return of the Titans and the fall of the world to their overwhelming might. Realizing that the world stood no chance without a force capable of resisting the Titans, Evorkia made a fateful decision.

Drawing upon her vast necromantic knowledge and sacrificing a portion of her own spirit, Evorkia created a new race: the orcs. These beings were designed to be fearless warriors, incapable of feeling fear in the face of even the most terrifying foes. However, the process of their creation came at a great cost to Evorkia herself.

In giving the orcs their fearless spirit, Evorkia was left in a precarious situation. Any positive aspects she kept for herself were ones the orcs could not possess. The result was a race of aggressive, fearless, but slow-thinking humanoids. Meanwhile, Evorkia found herself falling into a state of passivity and terror, her once-brilliant mind clouded by fear and doubt.

As Evorkia's mental state deteriorated, her warnings about the return of the Titans went unheeded by the wider world. Eventually, overcome by fear of her own creation, she fled from her research and the orcs, leaving them directionless. The orcs, lacking guidance, escaped into the world, their purpose unfulfilled.

Evorkia's fear drove her to further split her [spirit](Life and Death) in desperate attempts to regain her former self, but this only served to further deteriorate her mind. She descended into a state dominated by base desires and evil impulses. Today, Evorkia lives in complete isolation, a mere [shadow](Life and Death) of her once incredible influence, a tragic reminder of the price of unheeded prophecy and good intentions gone awry.

### The Return of Hykravones (10,210 - 10,209 BSD)

Before the mass exodus and death of the titans, one among them chose a different path. Hykravones, known as the Gray Prince, ventured into interdimensional space, disappearing from Alaria entirely. Millions of years passed before Hykravones made his untimely return.

Upon his arrival, Hykravones found a world utterly transformed, barely recognizable as the Alaria he once knew. The sight of this strange new realm, coupled with the absence of his fellow titans, drove Hykravones into a terrifying rage. With god-like power at his command, the Gray Prince began systematically dismantling Alaria.

Gaea's children, alongside several other peoples including the mysterious Vystrilik, rose to challenge Hykravones. The daemons across Celesté attempted to lend their aid, but their efforts were disjointed and ineffective. Many daemons, fearing the loss of their followers and influence, hesitated to commit fully to the fight. By the time they realized the true extent of the threat, it was already too late.

Hykravones' rampage was catastrophic. Nearly all civilization crumbled before his might, and countless daemons perished as their bases of followers were wiped out. The world was thrown back thousands of years technologically, with countless advancements and discoveries lost in the destruction.

After his furious assault on Alaria, Hykravones unexpectedly went dormant. He vanished from sight, never to be seen again. However, legends persist that the Gray Prince still lives, slumbering deep within Alaria's core, destined to one day reawaken and finish his work of destruction.

#### Rebirth of Gaea's Children

In the wake of Hykravones' devastation, a miraculous event occurred. From the blood-soaked soil where Gaea's fallen children lay, new life emerged. Three new races rose from this carnage: the Sharabha, the Ulvsjael, and the Naga. These beings, born from the essence of Gaea's original children, inherited their predecessors' connection to nature but evolved to thrive in the post-apocalyptic landscape left by Hykravones.

#### The Greatest Sacrifice

As Hykravones' destruction neared its zenith, the daemons of Celesté faced complete annihilation. In a desperate bid for survival, many of these divine beings made an unprecedented choice. They abandoned their realm, sneaking back to the material plane and taking on new, mortal forms.

This act of self-sacrifice and transformation gave rise to entirely new races, each descended from a daemon who chose existence over divinity. These new races, born from the essence of former gods, included:

- Gyv: Mysterious beings with an innate understanding of cosmic forces.
- Rusalka: Water-dwelling entities with hypnotic abilities.
- Pixies: Diminutive, mischievous creatures with a strong connection to nature magic.
- Jae-Kai: Known as "spirit wranglers," possessing the ability to communicate with and control spirits.
- Shapers: Recognizable by their silver eyes, these shapeshifters can alter their forms at will.
- Sarakiel: Often referred to as "evil angels of light," these beings wield radiant energy for both benevolent and malevolent purposes.
- Valkyries: Winged warriors with a strong sense of justice and combat prowess.
- Neferati: Red-skinned fire dancers with ram horns, maintaining a deep connection to Gaea.
- Xaphkiel: Cruel angels of darkness, manipulating shadows and negative emotions.
- Children of Anubis: Dog-headed guardians of the dead, tasked with protecting the boundary between life and death.
- Forsaken of Anubis: Rogue vigilantes who broke away from their brethren, using their powers for their own ends.
- Rhea: Gray-blue skinned people with a natural affinity for air and wind magic.
- Sivakr: Silver-skinned elves with the disconcerting ability to steal and manipulate memories.
- Nuun: Dark-skinned traders attuned to either fire or water, often found in [desert](Deserts) regions.
- Dark Elves: A now-extinct race of malicious dragon riders, their legacy living on only in myth and legend.

## The Modern Era (10,209 BSD - Present)

The Modern Era, comprising the third and current eon, began in the aftermath of Hykravones' rampage. This period has been marked by the slow rebuilding of civilization and the emergence of new powers and conflicts.

### The Great Expansion (9,950 - 0 BSD)

Not all perished in the cataclysm brought by Hykravones. Those who survived began the arduous task of rebuilding. This period, known as the Great Expansion, saw the gradual spread of the survivors and their descendants across Alaria.

New cities were founded, lost technologies were rediscovered or reinvented, and the new races born from the daemons' sacrifice began to carve out their places in the world. It was a time of exploration, innovation, and the forging of new alliances and enmities.

#### Frost Fall (8,840 - 8,695 BSD)

A significant event during the Great Expansion was the Frost Fall, a sudden and severe ice age that gripped much of Alaria for nearly 150 years. This period forced many civilizations to adapt quickly or perish, leading to significant technological advancements in areas such as insulation, food preservation, and magical heating.

The Frost Fall also saw the rise of the Winterborn, a group of humans who adapted to the extreme cold, developing natural resistances and affinities for ice magic. Their descendants continue to thrive in Alaria's coldest regions to this day.

#### The Return of Dragons (8,104 BSD)

After a long absence following Hykravones' destruction, dragons made a dramatic return to Alaria. Their reemergence was met with mixed reactions. While some saw the dragons as majestic beings of power and wisdom, others remembered the tyranny of draconic rule from ages past.

The return of dragons led to significant conflicts as they quickly began to reassert their dominance over large swathes of territory. This period saw a lot of fiery and bloody battles as various sentient [races](Races) struggled against draconic encroachment.

Some societies formed alliances with certain dragon factions, leading to the rise of dragon riders and dragon-blessed warriors. Others developed sophisticated anti-dragon weaponry and tactics. The presence of dragons once again became a major factor in shaping the political and military landscape of Alaria.

#### The World Fire (10 BSD)

The Great Expansion came to a fiery end with an event simply known as the World Fire. This global catastrophe, the exact cause of which remains debated by scholars, saw much of Alaria engulfed in flames. Entire continents burned, seas boiled, and the very air seemed to ignite.

The World Fire lasted for several months, reshaping coastlines, turning fertile lands to ash, and forcing mass migrations. When the flames finally subsided, the world that emerged was dramatically altered. This event is so significant that many calendars mark it as year zero, separating the time before and after the World Fire.

## The Seventh Dawn (0 SD - Present)

The period following the World Fire became known as the Seventh Dawn, symbolizing a new beginning for Alaria. This era has been marked by the rise of new powers, the rediscovery of ancient magics, and ongoing conflicts that continue to shape the world.

### The Dark Ages (0 - 231 SD)

The immediate aftermath of the World Fire plunged Alaria into a period known as the Dark Ages. Resources were scarce, and much knowledge had been lost in the flames. It was during this time that a group known as the Titansworn rose to prominence.

The Titansworn were deoric cultists, believed to be related to the enigmatic Vyanoweir. They sought to reawaken the titan Hykravones, convinced that only the power of the titans could save the world after it had burned. The Titansworn established temples and research centers in the ruins left by the ancient titans, their influence spreading across much of Alaria.

This period of Titansworn dominance came to an end with a great war against their cult. The conflict involved many factions, but notable among the opposition were the forces led by Athatgarun and Raiyurna, whose actions would be remembered in song and story for generations to come.

### The Time Puzzle (312 SD)

In the year 312 of the Seventh Dawn, a peculiar magical phenomenon occurred that came to be known as the Time Puzzle. For a brief period, time itself seemed to fracture, with different parts of Alaria experiencing time at different rates or even in reverse.

This event led to widespread confusion and chaos, but also to significant breakthroughs in the understanding of temporal magic. The effects of the Time Puzzle can still be seen in certain locations where time flows strangely, and in the emergence of chronomancers—mages specializing in time-based magic.

### The Peak of Hive Elves (400 SD)

By 400 SD, the Hive [Elves](Elves) had reached the height of their power. This unique subrace of [elves](Elves) was known for their collective mind, which allowed them to operate with unparalleled coordination. Under the guidance of their Matron, they expanded their influence across Alaria, establishing colonies deep in forests, mountains, and even underground. Their society thrived on the principles of unity and harmony, but this also led to an insular nature, making them wary of outsiders.

The Hive Elves' dominance was marked by their advanced mastery of Gaeic Magic, which they used to shape their surroundings, creating living structures that were both beautiful and functional. However, their peak also sowed the seeds of their eventual decline, as their rigid social structure struggled to adapt to the changing world beyond their borders.

### The Sivakr's Descent (1700 SD)

The once-proud Sivakr, a reptilian race known for their grand subterranean cities, were driven underground by a coalition of surface nations. This event marked the end of the Sivakr Empire’s golden age, as their enemies, fearing the Sivakr's rapid expansion and technological prowess, banded together to force them back to the caverns beneath Alaria.

For centuries, the Sivakr had relied on their formidable war machines and a unique form of metal-bending magic to maintain control over vast territories. Yet, the alliance of humans, dwarves, and orcs proved too powerful. The Sivakr retreated to the underground depths, where they rebuilt their society, becoming more reclusive and insular, but no less formidable. Today, their mysterious, maze-like cities continue to hold secrets from the world above.

### Tiira's Ascension (1800 SD)

In 1800 SD, a monumental event shook the world when Tiira, a mortal sorceress of unrivaled power, ascended to godhood. Known for her deep understanding of Gaeic and Azyen Magics, Tiira sought to transcend the limitations of mortal life. Legends say she achieved this through a ritual involving the alignment of several celestial bodies, the sacrifice of her own mortal form, and the absorption of ancient, forgotten magics.

Tiira's ascension marked a turning point in magical study, as her newfound divine presence influenced spellcraft and worship across Alaria. She became a deity of knowledge, transformation, and ambition, revered by those who sought to push the boundaries of magic and reality. Her followers, known as the Tiirath, established great academies and temples, spreading her teachings far and wide.

### The Creation of Goblins (1905 SD)

In 1905 SD, the [orcish](Orcs) lich Vezzarak sought to create a servile race to aid in his dark ambitions. Using forbidden necromantic and alchemical processes, he created the goblins—small, cunning, and resilient beings designed to serve the orcish hordes. However, Vezzarak underestimated his creations.

The goblins, contrary to his expectations, quickly became unruly, clever, and fiercely independent. They rebelled against their intended masters, escaping into the wilds and forming their own chaotic communities. Though they were initially viewed as mere pests, goblins adapted and survived, carving out a niche in the world. To this day, they are often treated with disdain, seen as an "escaped slave race" born from a misguided experiment.

### Chimea's Invasion (2900 SD)

In 2900 SD, the powerful nation of Chimea embarked on a massive military campaign across the Pelakan Sea, launching an invasion of Gyendoveir and Yystrilik. This marked the beginning of a bloody and protracted war that continues to this day. Chimea, known for its disciplined army and mastery of Azyen Magic, sought to expand its territory and control key trade routes.

The invasion triggered a widespread conflict, drawing in numerous allies and enemies. The war has led to widespread devastation, particularly in the contested lands where constant skirmishes have left the [region](Regions) scarred and divided. Despite numerous peace attempts, the conflict persists, driven by political ambitions, ancient grudges, and the strategic importance of the lands at stake.

### Present Day (3376 SD)

The world of Alaria stands on the brink of significant change. Tensions are high as the war between Chimea and the southern nations shows no sign of ending. The Sivakr continue to bide their time underground, and the Hive Elves remain in their secluded domains, wary of external influences. Meanwhile, the followers of Tiira strive to uncover new magics, and the goblins, ever resourceful, thrive in the shadows of larger societies.

The Seventh Dawn has brought about both prosperity and conflict, with ancient powers stirring and new alliances forming. What the future holds is uncertain, but the legacy of past events continues to shape the present, and the actions of those who walk Alaria's lands now will determine its fate for centuries to come.

Through powerful magic performed eons ago, the Zaelian found a way to channel the light from the moon into their bodies, allowing them to perform some Deoric magic without the cost of their own life. Although their capacity is limited, it allows them to perform even more magic.

This close association with Deoric magic is a significant cause of distrust for most other [races](Races), and it’s not entirely unfounded. While most Zaelian are benevolent and empathetic, sects have been known to more fully embrace the Deoric spell casting lifestyle, and use the lives of prisoners and slaves in addition to moonlight to cast their spells.

Zaelian culture revolves around the push and pull of sacrifice and progress. How much are you willing to give up to get what you want? The most influential Zaelian figures are known for giving up everything to succeed. In addition to that, most Zaelian have some sort of familial tradition dictating the rituals around gathering moonlight for oaths.
Zaelian can be found across Alaria, and are infamous for the number of liches that have arisen from their communities.

The [Zaelian](Zaelian) [elves](Elves), also known as Children of the Moon, are a [race](Races) of [elves](Elves) who worship the moon and the magical power that it grants.

# Zylogmus Eternus

Tags: [region](Regions)

Stretching all the way across the [material plane](Material Plane), [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) is the "infinite labrynth". Houseing all manners of horrors, and plagued by a terrible curse, [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) is one of the worst places you can possibly find yourself.

[Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) is an enormous maze of corridors and tunnels spanning thousands of miles, built on the lower surface of the [Material Plane](Material Plane). It has undergone countless modifications and iterations over the eons, and is a hodgepodge of new and old. [Factions](Factions) control various parts of this megadungeon, vying for power, but their borders are constantly shifting, as the fight for territory is fought nearly ceaselessly. Dividing all of it is an invisible grid. Nobody knows exactly where the grid lines pass through, but once every month, a random person from within that grid doesn’t wake up that night, dying painlessly in their sleep. If someone is sacrificed (burned alive) in one of the eternally burning braziers scattered through the labyrinth, that grid square can avoid having a random person killed.

Up above, there is the Meat Grinder—an impenetrable ceiling of twisting gears and blades. No one has ever gotten through this alive to live the tale. Below, their is the abyss—less explored, more dangerous dungeon. All sorts of rumors exist about what lives the deeper you go, but as with the Meat Grinder, few make it back

Scattered throughout the dungeon are the sacrificier braziers, used to burn those who are given over to the dungeon.

The shadows of the dead come out at night and kill those who are still wandering the hallways. Curfews are enforced.

Many governments have enforced sacrificial pools—they sacrifice those who are weak in order to ensure the safety of themselves.

At the bottom of the dungeon is [Emphathum](Emphathum), and then a long journey through the [Underrealms](Underrealms) to the surface. No one has made it down, as it is guarded by...?

Very few people ever pick up attunements to anything other than the secondary elements, since they spend their entire lives away from stone, fire, fresh air, and clean water.

# History

In a long forgotten time ago, Phlethageros' surface was ruled over by the powerful kingdom of [Trivulin](Trivulin). United, the people of Trivulin faught against the demons above, holding them at bay for centuries. An order of paladins known as the Demon Slayers protected the land, and were perhaps the most noble and powerful order of knights to ever exist in all of [Alaria](Alaria). For a millenia, both the demons of Geth and Trivulin remained neck and neck.

The delicate balance came to an end, however, when [Xeros](Xeros), the king's brother, betrayed his people and allied himself with [Gorthrusk the Deceiver](Gorthrusk the Deceiver) in order to assassinate his brother and ascend as king. However, [Gorthrusk](Gorthrusk the Deceiver) used his allyship to weaken the empire by accusing the Demon Slayers of treason, having many of them killed for their ficticious crimes.

Among the demon slayers who remained were the brothers [Averos](Averos) and [Perleus](Perleus). They were determined to avenge the treachery of [Xeros](Xeros), and shortly after he ascended the throne, the brothers murdered him and temporarily claimed the throne for themselves until a new king could be decided. With a crippled order of paladins, and a kingdom's succession in question, the defenses of Trivinum began to falter. By the end of the year, Trivinum survival was in question.

With no other options, the two paladin brother kings cast two spells with the aid and sacrifice of their kingdom to forever protect their world. The younger brother cast a spell to make an impenetrable wall between their kingdom and the raining hell above, and the elder brother cast a spell cursing the demons to slowly die.

Unfortunately, one of the most powerful demons infiltrated and corrupted the elder brother's spell, reflecting it upon their own kingdom, cursing them to make sacrifices forever. Eldest brother sacrifices himself in shame as first sacrifice for the kingdom.
